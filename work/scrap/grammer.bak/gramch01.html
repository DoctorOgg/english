<A NAME="1"></A>
<CENTER><B>1. Grammar</B></CENTER><BR>
The <B>grammar</B>  of a language is an analysis of the various functions performed by the words of the language, as they are used by native speakers and writers.<BR>
<BR>
There are many different ways of analyzing a language. In such an
analysis, words can be given various names, depending on the function
which they perform. For instance, words which perform the function of
naming things are commonly referred to as <B>nouns</B>, and words which perform the function of expressing states or actions are commonly referred to as <B>verbs</B>.<BR>
<BR>
It should be kept in mind that many English words can perform more than one function. For instance, in the following sentences, the underlined words can be referred to as <B>nouns</B>  because they perform the function of naming things.<BR>
e.g. I have lost my <U>comb</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Water</U> is one of the necessities of life.<BR>
<BR>
However, in the following sentences, the same words can be referred to as <B>verbs</B> because they perform the function of expressing actions.<BR>
e.g. I <U>comb</U> my hair every morning.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do you <U>water</U> your plants once a week?<BR>
<BR>
In this book, widely used terms such as <B>noun</B>, <B>verb</B>, <B>pronoun</B> and so on, will be used in order to explain the way in which words function in the English language.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="2"></A>
<CENTER><B>2. Verb forms</B></CENTER><BR>
English verbs may have different forms, depending on the <B>subject</B> of the verb, and depending on when the action expressed by the verb takes place.<BR>
<BR>
In the following sentences, the subjects of the verbs indicate who or
what is performing the actions expressed by the verbs. The verbs in
these examples are underlined.<BR>
e.g. We <U>live</U> in the city.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He <U>lives</U> on Queen Street.<BR>
<BR>
These examples illustrate how the form of a verb may vary, depending on the subject of the verb. In the first example, the subject is <B>we</B>, and the form of the verb is <B>live</B>. In the second example, the subject is <B>he</B>, and the form of the verb is <B>lives</B>.<BR>

<!--page 2-->
<BR>
The different verb forms which indicate when the action expressed by
a verb takes place are usually referred to as <B>tenses</B>.<BR>
e.g. We always <U>walk</U> to work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We <U>walked</U> to work yesterday.<BR>
<BR>
In the first sentence, the verb <B>walk</B> is in the Simple Present tense. In the second sentence, the verb <B>walked</B> is in the Simple Past tense. Present tenses are usually used to express actions which are taking place in the present; whereas past tenses are usually used to express actions which took place in the past.<BR>
<BR>
The <B>infinitive</B> form of a verb can be used without reference to any particular subject or any particular time. In English, the infinitive form of a verb begins with the word <B>to</B>. For instance, <B>to walk</B> is the infinitive of the verb used in the two preceding examples.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
<A NAME="3"></A>
<CENTER><B>3. Uses of the simple present tense</B></CENTER><BR>
The Simple Present is one of four present tenses in English, and is used in various ways. In the examples given below, the verbs in the Simple Present tense are underlined.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, the Simple Present can be used to refer to actions which occur at regular intervals.<BR>
e.g. We <U>visit</U> our friends every Sunday.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They <U>take</U> a holiday once a year.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Geese <U>fly</U> south every fall.<BR>
<BR>
The Simple Present is also used in stating general truths.<BR>
e.g. Gas <U>expands</U> when heated.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Pacific Ocean <U>is</U> the largest ocean in the world.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Canada <U>lies</U> north of the United States.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, the Simple Present is used when referring to printed
material, and when describing events portrayed in a book, film, or
other work of art.<BR>
e.g. The report <U>presents</U> the information clearly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the end of the film , the hero <U>finds</U> the hidden treasure.<BR>
<BR>
Occasionally, the Simple Present is used to express actions occurring in the future or the past.<BR>
<BR>
e.g. Our plane <U>leaves</U> at eight o'clock tomorrow night.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Burglar <U>Steals</U> Valuable Paintings<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the Simple Present is used to refer to something which will happen in the future. In the second example, which is written in the style of a newspaper headline, the Simple Present is used to refer to something which happened in the past.<P>

<CENTER><B>4. The simple present of the verb To Be</B></CENTER><BR>
A <B>conjugation</B> of a verb is a list showing the different forms a verb may take. When a verb is conjugated, it is usually accompanied by all of the <B>personal pronouns</B> which can act as subjects of a verb. Thus, a conjugation can show the different forms a verb must take when it is used with different subjects.<BR>
<BR>
The English personal pronouns which may be used as subjects of verbs are as follows:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>I</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>you</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>he</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>she</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>it</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>we</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>they</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER><BR>

<A NAME="4th"></A>
It should be noted that in modern English, the same verb forms are
used with the subject <B>you</B>, whether <B>you</B> refers to one or more than one person or thing. In an older form of English, there was another personal pronoun, <B>thou</B>, which was used with different verb forms, and which generally referred to one person or thing.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="4co"></A>
The Simple Present of the verb <B>to be</B> is conjugated as follows. In spoken English, contractions are often used.<BR><BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With contractions</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I am</TD><TD>&nbsp; I'm</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; you are</TD><TD>&nbsp; you're</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; he is</TD><TD>&nbsp; he's</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; she is</TD><TD>&nbsp; she's</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; it is</TD><TD>&nbsp; it's</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; we are</TD><TD>&nbsp; we're</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; they are</TD><TD>&nbsp; they're</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="4ap"></A>
In written English, an apostrophe: <B>'</B> is used in a contraction, to indicate that one or more letters have been omitted.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="4a"></A>
<B>a. Affirmative statements</B><BR>
An affirmative statement states that something is true. In an
affirmative statement, the verb follows the subject.<BR>
e.g. I am awake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are ready.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the verb <B>am</B> follows the subject <B>I</B>. In the second example, the verb <B>are</B> follows the subject <B>they</B>.
<A NAME="4ad"></A>
 In written English, statements are always followed by a period: <B>.</B> Statements and questions must begin with a capital letter.<BR>
<BR>
In order to review the preceding points, see <A HREF="gramex01.html#1">Exercise 1</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<!--page 4-->
<A NAME="4b"></A>
<B>b. Questions</B><BR>
For the Simple Present of the verb <B>to be</B>, questions are formed by reversing the order of the subject and the verb, so that the verb
precedes the subject.<BR>
e.g. Am I awake?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are they ready?<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the verb <B>am</B> precedes the subject <B>I</B>. In the second example, the verb <B>are</B> precedes the subject <B>they</B>. 
<A NAME="4bq"></A>
In written English, questions are always followed by a question mark: <B>?</B><BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex01.html#2">Exercise 2</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="4c"></A>
<B>c. Negative statements</B><BR>
In the Simple Present of the verb <B>to be</B>, negative statements are formed by adding the word <B>not</B> after the verb.<BR>
e.g. I am <U>not</U> awake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are <U>not</U> ready.<BR>
In the first example, <B>not</B> follows the verb <B>am</B>. In the second example, <B>not</B> follows the verb <B>are</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="4cis"></A>
<BR>
In spoken English, the following contractions are often used:<BR><BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With contractions</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; is not</TD><TD>&nbsp; isn't</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; are not</TD><TD>&nbsp; aren't</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex01.html#3">Exercise 3</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="4d"></A>
<B>d. Negative questions</B><BR>
In the Simple Present of the verb <B>to be</B>, negative questions are formed by reversing the order of the subject and verb, and adding <B>not</B> after the subject.<BR>
e.g. Am I not awake?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are they not ready?<BR>
<BR>
In spoken English, contractions are usually used in negative questions. In the contracted form of a negative question, the contraction of <B>not</B> follows immediately after the verb. For example:<BR><BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With contractions</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Are you not awake?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Aren't you awake?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Is he not awake?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Isn't he awake?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Are we not awake?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Aren't we awake?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Are they not awake?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Aren't they awake?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
It should be noted that there is no universally accepted contraction
for <B>am not</B>. In spoken English, <B>am I not?</B> is often contracted to <B>aren't I?</B>. However, although the expression <B>aren't I?</B> is considered acceptable in informal English, it is not considered to be grammatically correct in formal English. In formal English, no contraction should be used for <B>am I not</B>.<BR><BR>

<!--page 5-->
See <A HREF="gramex01.html#4">Exercise 4</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="4e"></A>
<B>e. Tag questions</B><BR>
A <B>tag question</B> is a question added at the end of a sentence. A tag question following an affirmative statement generally has the form of a negative question, with the meaning: <B>Isn't that true?</B> In some languages, such tag questions are invariable. However, in English, tag questions vary, depending on the verbs and subjects of the preceding statements.<BR>
<BR>
In the following examples, the tag questions are underlined. Contractions are usually used in negative tag questions. For example:<BR><BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Affirmative statement with tag question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Are you not awake?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Aren't you awake?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I am awake.</TD><TD>&nbsp; I am awake, <U>am I not</U>?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; You are awake.</TD><TD>&nbsp; You are awake, <U>aren't you</U>?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; She is awake.</TD><TD>&nbsp; She is awake, <U>isn't she</U>?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; We are awake.</TD><TD>&nbsp; We are awake, <U>aren't we</U>?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They are awake.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They are awake, <U>aren't they</U>?</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
These examples illustrate how the subjects and verbs of the preceding
statements are repeated in tag questions. For instance, in the first
example, the subject <B>I</B> and the verb <B>am</B> are repeated in the tag question. In the second example, the subject <B>you</B> and the verb <B>are</B> are repeated in the tag question.<BR>
<A NAME="4ear"></A>
<BR>
In spoken English, the expression <B>aren't I?</B> is often used as a tag question. However, this is not considered to be grammatically correct in formal, written English.<BR>
