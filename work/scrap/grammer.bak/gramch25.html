<CENTER><B>1. Adverbs of manner</B></CENTER><BR>

Adverbs of manner are the largest group of adverbs. Most adverbs of
manner are closely related to corresponding adjectives. Although some
words can be used as either adjectives or adverbs, in most cases, adverbs
of manner are formed by adding <B>ly</B> to the corresponding adjectives.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1a"></A>
<B>a. Spelling rules for adding ly</B><BR>
In most cases, <B>ly</B> is simply added to the positive form of the
adjective. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<TR><TD>&nbsp; surprising</TD><TD>&nbsp; surprisingly</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<A NAME="1a1"></A>
<B>i. Adjectives ending in ic</B><BR>
However, when the adjective ends in <B>ic</B>,
the syllable <B>al</B> is usually added before the <B>ly</B> ending. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Adjective</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Adverb of Manner</B></U></TD></TR>

</TABLE>
<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1a2"></A>
<B>ii. Adjectives ending in le</B><BR>
When the adjective ends in <B>le</B> preceded by a
<U>consonant</U>, the final <B>e</B> is usually changed to <B>y</B>, to form the <B>ly</B> ending. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Adjective</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Adverb of Manner</B></U></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; humble</TD><TD>&nbsp; humbly</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; simple</TD><TD>&nbsp; simply</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
When the adjective ends in <B>le</B> preceded by a <U>vowel</U>, in most cases, <B>ly</B>
is simply added to the positive form of the adjective. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<TR><TD>&nbsp; sole</TD><TD>&nbsp; solely</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
However, in the case of the adjective <B>whole</B>, the final <B>e</B> is removed
before the ending <B>ly</B> is added:<BR>
<BR>

<BR>

<!--page 338-->
<A NAME="1a3"></A>
<B>iii. Adjectives ending in ll</B><BR>
When the adjective ends in <B>ll</B>, only <B>y</B>
is added. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Adjective</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Adverb of Manner</B></U></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; shrill</TD><TD>&nbsp; shrilly</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1a4"></A>
<B>iv. Adjectives ending in ue</B><BR>
When the adjective ends in <B>ue</B>, the final
<B>e</B> is usually omitted before the ending <B>ly</B> is added. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Adjective</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Adverb of Manner</B></U></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; true</TD><TD>&nbsp; truly</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1a5"></A>
<B>v. Adjectives ending in y</B><BR>
When the adjective ends in <B>y</B> preceded by
a <U>consonant</U>, the <B>y</B> is usually changed to <B>i</B> before the ending <B>ly</B>
is added. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Adjective</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Adverb of Manner</B></U></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; easy</TD><TD>&nbsp; easily</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; happy</TD><TD>&nbsp; happily</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
However, in the case of the adjectives <B>shy</B> and <B>sly</B>, <B>ly</B> is simply
added to the positive form of the adjective:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Adjective</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Adverb of Manner</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; shy</TD><TD>&nbsp; shyly</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; sly</TD><TD>&nbsp; slyly</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
When the adjective ends in <B>y</B> preceded by a <U>vowel</U>, in most cases, <B>ly</B>
is simply added to the positive form of the adjective. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Adjective</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Adverb of Manner</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; coy</TD><TD>&nbsp; coyly</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; grey</TD><TD>&nbsp; greyly</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
However, in the case of the adjective <B>gay</B>, <B>y</B> is changed to <B>i</B>
before the ending <B>ly</B> is added:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Adjective</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Adverb of Manner</B></U></TD></TR>

<A NAME="1a5ly"></A>
<BR>
It should be noted that while most adverbs which end in <B>ly</B> are adverbs
of manner, other types of adverb may also end in <B>ly</B>. For instance,

<!--page 339-->
<B>consequently</B> and <B>subsequently</B> are connecting adverbs. The
following are adverbs of frequency which are formed by adding <B>ly</B>
to the corresponding adjectives.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>

<A NAME="1b"></A>
<B>b. Adverbs which do not use the ending ly</B><BR>
The adverb of manner <B>well</B> appears unrelated to the corresponding
adjective, <B>good</B>. <B>Good</B> and <B>well</B> both have the comparative form
<B>better</B> and the superlative form <B>best</B>.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Adjective</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Adverb of Manner</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; good</TD><TD>&nbsp; well</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
It should be noted that in addition to being used as an adverb, the word
<B>well</B> can also be used as an adjective with the meaning <B>healthy</B>. The
adjective <B>well</B> is most often used as a predicate adjective.<BR>
e.g. <U><B>Well</B> used as an Adjective</U>: I hope you are <B>well</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U><B>Well</B> used as an Adverb</U>: He did <B>well</B> on the examination.<BR>
In the first example, <B>well</B> is a predicate adjective, modifying the
pronoun <B>you</B>. In the second example, <B>well</B> is an adverb of manner,
modifying the verb <B>did</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="1bsf"></A>
<BR>
The following table gives examples of adverbs of manner, location, time
and frequency which have the same forms as the corresponding adjectives.<BR>

<BR>
It should also be noted that there are several adjectives ending in <B>ly</B>
which have no corresponding adverbs:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; friendly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; likely<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lively<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lonely<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; silly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ugly<BR>
<BR>
When it is desired to use one of these words to modify a verb, an adverb
phrase of manner may be used. In the following examples, the adverb
phrases are underlined.<BR>
e.g. He behaved <U>in a friendly manner</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They acted <U>in a silly way</U>.<BR>
<A NAME="1bdf"></A>
<BR>
The following table gives examples of pairs of adverbs which are closely
related, but which have different meanings.<BR>

The meanings of these adverbs are illustrated in the following examples.<BR>
e.g. I worked <B>hard</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have <B>hardly</B> enough time to finish.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He threw the ball <B>high</B> into the air.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is <B>highly</B> successful in what he does.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The class began <B>late</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The weather has been cold <B>lately</B>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I held my breath as the squirrel crept <B>near</B> to get the nuts.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have <B>nearly</B> finished reading the book.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I opened the door <B>wide</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That theory is <B>widely</B> believed.<BR>

<A NAME="1c"></A>
<B>c. The differing functions of adjectives and adverbs</B><BR>
When an adverb differs in form from a corresponding adjective, it is
necessary to distinguish between the functions of adjectives
and adverbs in order to determine which form should be used in a given
situation.<BR>
<BR>
Whereas adjectives modify nouns, pronouns, and expressions which serve
the same grammatical functions as nouns; adverbs modify verbs, adjectives
and adverbs.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1c1"></A>
<B>i. Adjectives which modify nouns compared with adverbs which modify verbs</B><BR>
The following examples illustrate the distinction which must be made
between adjectives which modify nouns and adverbs which modify verbs. The adjectives and adverbs are printed in bold type,
and the words which are modified are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <U>Adjective</U>: It has been a <B>quiet</B> <U>afternoon</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Adverb</U>: The afternoon <U>passed</U> <B>quietly</B>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Adjective</U>: She is a <B>good</B> <U>musician</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Adverb</U>: She <U>plays</U> the flute very <B>well</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In the first pair of sentences, the adjective <B>quiet</B> modifies the noun
<B>afternoon</B>, whereas the adverb <B>quietly</B> modifies the verb <B>passed</B>. In
the second pair of sentences, the adjective <B>good</B> modifies the noun
<B>musician</B>, whereas the adverb <B>well</B> modifies the verb <B>plays</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In informal English, adjectives are sometimes used to modify verbs.<BR>
e.g. She plays good.<BR>
In this example, the adjective <B>good</B> is used to modify the verb <B>plays</B>.
However, this use of adjectives is considered to be grammatically
incorrect.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex25.html#3">Exercise 3</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1c2"></A>
<B>ii. Adjectives which modify nouns compared with adverbs which modify adjectives</B><BR>
The following examples illustrate the distinction which must be made
between adjectives which modify nouns and adverbs which modify adjectives.<BR>
e.g. <U>Adjective</U>: a <B>large</B> wooden <U>building</U><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Adverb</U>: a <B>largely</B> <U>wooden</U> building<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Adjective</U>: <B>conspicuous</B> dark <U>clouds</U><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Adverb</U>: <B>conspicuously</B> <U>dark</U> clouds<BR>
<BR>
In the first pair of phrases, the adjective <B>large</B> modifies the noun
<B>building</B>, and the adverb <B>largely</B> modifies the adjective <B>wooden</B>.
Thus, the phrase <B>a large wooden building</B> has the meaning <B>a big wooden
building</B>, whereas the phrase <B>a largely wooden building</B> has the meaning
<B>a building mostly made of wood</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In the second pair of phrases, the adjective <B>conspicuous</B> modifies the
noun <B>clouds</B>, and the adverb <B>conspicuously</B> modifies the adjective
<B>dark</B>. Thus, the phrase <B>conspicuous dark clouds</B> means that the clouds themselves
are noticeable; whereas the phrase <B>conspicuously dark clouds</B> means that
the darkness of the clouds is noticeable.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex25.html#4">Exercise 4</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 342-->
<A NAME="1c3"></A>
<B>iii. Predicate adjectives which modify the subjects of verbs compared with adverbs which modify verbs</B><BR>
As pointed out previously, certain verbs, called
<B>linking verbs</B>, can be followed by predicate adjectives. A distinction
must be made between predicate adjectives which modify the subjects of
linking verbs, and adverbs which modify verbs.<BR>
<BR>
A few linking verbs, such as the verb <B>to be</B>, can be followed by
predicate adjectives, but <U>cannot</U> be modified by adverbs of manner. In the following examples using the verb <B>to be</B>, the nouns which are modified are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <U>He</U> is <B>happy</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The <U>wind</U> was <B>strong</B>.<BR>
In these examples, the predicate adjectives <B>happy</B> and <B>strong</B> modify
the subjects <B>he</B> and <B>wind</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="1c3ap"></A>
<BR>
However, there are several verbs which can be used either as linking
verbs followed by predicate adjectives, or as non-linking verbs modified
by adverbs of manner. The following examples illustrate the use of the
verb <B>to appear</B> as a linking verb and as a non-linking verb.<BR>
e.g. <U>Linking Verb</U>: His <U>uncle</U> appeared <B>kind</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Non-linking Verb</U>: His uncle <U>appeared</U> <B>punctually</B> at ten o'clock.<BR>
<BR>In the first example, <B>kind</B> is a predicate adjective which modifies the
noun <B>uncle</B>. In the second example, <B>punctually</B> is an adverb of manner
which modifies the verb <B>appeared</B>.<BR>
<BR>
The verbs below can be used either as linking or non-linking verbs:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to appear</TD><TD>&nbsp; to become</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to feel</TD><TD>&nbsp; to grow</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to look</TD><TD>&nbsp; to remain</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to smell</TD><TD>&nbsp; to sound</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to taste</TD><TD>&nbsp; to turn</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
<A NAME="1c3gr"></A>
If the <U>subject</U> of the verb is to be modified, a
predicate adjective is required after such verbs; whereas if the <U>verb</U> is to be modified,
an adverb is required. In the pairs of examples below, the verbs <B>to
grow</B>, <B>to look</B> and <B>to turn</B> are used first as linking verbs followed
by adjectives, and then as non-linking verbs modified by adverbs. The
adjectives and adverbs are printed in bold type, and the words which are modified are underlined.<BR>
<BR>e.g. <U>Adjective</U>: As he became old, <U>he</U> grew <B>slow</B> at remembering dates.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Adverb</U>: The tree <U>grew</U> <B>slowly</B>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Adjective</U>: <U>They</U> looked <B>anxious</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Adverb</U>: We <U>looked</U> <B>anxiously</B> up the street.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Adjective</U>: The <U>weather</U> turned <B>cold</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Adverb</U>: She <U>turned</U> <B>coldly</B> away from the salesman.<BR>
<BR>
In these examples, the predicate adjectives <B>slow</B>, <B>anxious</B> and
<B>cold</B> modify the subjects <B>he</B>, <B>they</B> and <B>weather</B>; whereas the
adverbs of manner <B>slowly</B>, <B>anxiously</B> and <B>coldly</B> modify the verbs
<B>grew</B>, <B>looked</B> and <B>turned</B>.<BR>

<B>a. The formation of comparative and superlative forms of adverbs</B><BR>
It should be noted that many adverbs, such as <B>sometimes</B>, <B>never</B>, <B>here</B>,
<B>there</B>, <B>now</B>, <B>then</B>, <B>first</B>, <B>again</B>, <B>yesterday</B> and <B>daily</B> have no

<BR>

<A NAME="2a1"></A>
<B>i. Adverbs used with More and Most</B><BR>
Most adverbs used in comparisons,
including those formed from corresponding adjectives by adding the ending
<B>ly</B>, form the comparative with the word <B>more</B>, and the superlative with
the word <B>most</B>. For example:<BR>

</TABLE><BR>
It should be noted that adverbs formed by adding <B>ly</B> to one-syllable
adjectives are sometimes used with the endings <B>er</B> and <B>est</B>.<BR>
e.g. We walked <U>slower and slower</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They sang the <U>softest</U>.<BR>
<BR>However, in modern English, it is generally considered to be more correct
to write:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We walked <U>more and more slowly</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They sang the <U>most softly</U>.<BR>

<B>b. Positive forms of adverbs used in comparisons</B><BR>
The constructions employed when adverbs are used in comparisons are very
similar to those employed when adjectives are used in comparisons.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2b1"></A>
<B>i. The construction with As ... As</B><BR>
When used in making comparisons,
the positive form of an adverb is usually preceded and followed by <B>as</B>.
This construction is summarized below, followed by examples.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>as</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; positive form&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>as</B></TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can run</TD><TD>&nbsp; as</TD><TD>&nbsp; fast</TD><TD>&nbsp; as</TD><TD>&nbsp; you can.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He moves</TD><TD>&nbsp; as</TD><TD>&nbsp; slowly</TD><TD>&nbsp; as</TD><TD>&nbsp; a snail.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her eyes shone</TD><TD>&nbsp; as</TD><TD>&nbsp; brightly</TD><TD>&nbsp; as</TD><TD>&nbsp; stars.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
If desired, an adverb may be placed before the first occurrence of <B>as</B>:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; <U>adverb</U>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>as</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; positive form&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>as</B></TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her eyes shone</TD><TD>&nbsp; <U>almost</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; as</TD><TD>&nbsp; brightly</TD><TD>&nbsp; as</TD><TD>&nbsp; stars.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<A NAME="2b2"></A>
<BR><B>ii. Ellipsis</B><BR>
Ellipsis is often employed in comparisons using adverbs. For
instance, in the second half of such comparisons, instead of repeating the
verb, the first auxiliary may be used, or the verb may be omitted entirely.
In the following examples, the words which would usually be omitted are
enclosed in square brackets.<BR>
e.g. I can run as fast as you can [run].<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He moves as slowly as a snail [moves].<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her eyes shone as brightly as stars [shine].<BR>

<BR>
<A NAME="2c1"></A>
<B>i. The construction with Than</B><BR>
When used in making comparisons, the
comparative form of an adverb is usually followed by <B>than</B>. This
construction is summarized below, followed by examples.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; comparative form&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>than</B></TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He can swim</TD><TD>&nbsp; farther</TD><TD>&nbsp; than</TD><TD>&nbsp; I can.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She sings</TD><TD>&nbsp; more beautifully</TD><TD>&nbsp; than</TD><TD>&nbsp; her sister does.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<!--page 345-->
As is the case with comparisons using adjectives, comparisons using
adverbs can be combined with phrases or clauses.<BR>
e.g. She performs <B>better</B> <U>in front of an audience</U> <B>than</B> she does <U>in rehearsal</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They walked <B>faster</B> <U>when they were on their way to school</U> <B>than</B> they did<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>when they were on their way home</U>.<BR>
<BR>In the first example, the two situations being compared are distinguished
by the phrases <B>in front of an audience</B> and <B>in rehearsal</B>. In the
second example, the two situations being compared are distinguished by
the clauses <B>when they were on their way to school</B> and <B>when they were
on their way home</B>. The use of ellipsis should be noted. In the first
example, the auxiliary <B>does</B> is used instead of repeating the verb
<B>performs</B>. In the second example, the auxiliary <B>did</B> is used instead
of repeating the verb <B>walked</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2c2"></A>
<B>ii. Progressive comparisons</B><BR>
The comparative forms of adverbs can be used
in progressive comparisons. For adverbs with the ending <B>er</B>, the following
construction is used:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; comparative form&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>and</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; comparative form</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>e.g. &nbsp; The plane flew</TD><TD>&nbsp; higher</TD><TD>&nbsp; and</TD><TD>&nbsp; higher.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The team performed</TD><TD>&nbsp; better</TD><TD>&nbsp; and</TD><TD>&nbsp; better.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
The meanings expressed in these examples can also be expressed as follows:<BR>
e.g. The plane flew increasingly high.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The team performed increasingly well.<BR>
<A NAME="2c2m"></A>
<BR>
For adverbs which form the comparative with <B>more</B>, the following
construction is used:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>more</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>and</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>more</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; positive form</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He solved the problems</TD><TD>&nbsp; more</TD><TD>&nbsp; and</TD><TD>&nbsp; more</TD><TD>&nbsp; easily.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We visited them</TD><TD>&nbsp; more</TD><TD>&nbsp; and</TD><TD>&nbsp; more</TD><TD>&nbsp; frequently.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
The meanings expressed in these examples can also be expressed as follows:<BR>
e.g. He solved the problems increasingly easily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We visited them increasingly frequently.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2c3"></A>
<B>iii. The construction with Less and Less</B><BR>
A similar construction,
employing the expression <B>less and less</B>, can also be used. The
expressions <B>less and less</B> and <B>more and more</B> have opposite meanings.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>less</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>and</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>less</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; positive form</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We visited them</TD><TD>&nbsp; less</TD><TD>&nbsp; and</TD><TD>&nbsp; less</TD><TD>&nbsp; frequently.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
The meanings expressed in these examples can also be expressed as follows:<BR>
e.g. He solved the problems decreasingly easily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We visited them decreasingly frequently.<BR>
<BR>

<B>iv. The construction with The ..., the ...</B><BR>
Two clauses, each beginning with <B>the</B>, and each containing a comparative form of an adjective or
adverb, can be used together in order to indicate a cause and effect
relationship between two different things or events. This construction
is summarized below, followed by examples.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; comparative</TD><TD>&nbsp; 1st part of</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; comparative</TD><TD>&nbsp; 2nd part of</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; The</TD><TD>&nbsp; more</TD><TD>&nbsp; they eat,</TD><TD>&nbsp; the</TD><TD>&nbsp; fatter</TD><TD>&nbsp; they get.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; The</TD><TD>&nbsp; faster</TD><TD>&nbsp; we skated,</TD><TD>&nbsp; the</TD><TD>&nbsp; warmer</TD><TD>&nbsp; we felt.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
The following are further examples of the use of this type of construction.
In these examples, the comparative forms are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <B>The</B> <U>more cleverly</U> we hid the Easter eggs, <B>the</B> <U>more enthusiastically</U> the children searched for them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>The</B> <U>more</U> I scold her, <B>the</B> <U>worse</U> she behaves.<BR>
As shown in the examples, in this type of construction the two clauses
beginning with <B>the</B> must be separated by a comma.<BR>

<B>d. Superlative forms of adverbs used in comparisons</B><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="2d1"></A>
<B>i. The construction with The</B><BR>
When used in making comparisons, the
superlative form of an adverb is usually preceded by <B>the</B>. This
construction is summarized below, followed by examples.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>the</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; superlative form</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They sing</TD><TD>&nbsp; the</TD><TD>&nbsp; most sweetly</TD><TD>&nbsp; of all the choirs I have heard.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
See <A HREF="gramex25.html#8">Exercises 8</A> and <A HREF="gramex25.html#9">9</A>.<BR>
<BR>
In the case of adverbs which form the superlative with the ending <B>est</B>,
the superlative is sometimes preceded by a possessive adjective, instead of
by the definite article, <B>the</B>. In the following examples,
the possessive adjectives are printed in bold type.<BR>
e.g. He ran <B>his</B> fastest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I did <B>my</B> best.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2d2"></A>
<B>ii. The construction with The Least</B><BR>
Adverbs may also be preceded by
the expression <B>the least</B>. This construction is summarized below, followed by examples. The
words <B>least</B> and <B>most</B> have opposite meanings.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
