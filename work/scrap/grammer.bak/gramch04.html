<CENTER><B>1. Use of the present perfect</B></CENTER><BR>
The English Present Perfect tense is used to express actions which
have already been completed, or <B>perfected</B>, at the time of speaking or
writing. In the examples given below, the verbs in the Present Perfect
tense are underlined.<BR>
e.g. I <U>have done</U> the work.<BR>
She <U>has answered</U> half the questions.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the use of the Present Perfect tense emphasizes
the fact that, at the time of speaking or writing, the work has already
been completed. In the second example, the use of the Present Perfect
indicates that, at the time of speaking or writing, half the questions
have been answered.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="2"></A>
<CENTER><B>2. Formation of the present perfect: Regular verbs</B></CENTER><BR>
The Present Perfect tense of any English verb is formed from the Simple
Present of the auxiliary <B>to have</B>, followed by what is generally
referred to as the <B>past participle</B> of the verb.<BR>
<BR>
Most English verbs form the past participle in a regular, predictable
manner. These verbs are commonly referred to as <B>regular verbs</B>.<BR>
<BR>
The past participle of a regular English verb is formed by adding the
ending <B>ed</B> to the bare infinitive of the verb. For instance, the past
participle of the verb <B>to work</B> is <B>worked</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, the Present Perfect tense of the verb <B>to work</B> is conjugated as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>I have worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>you have worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>he has worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>she has worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>it has worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>we have worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>they have worked</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>3. Spelling rules for adding ed to form the past participle</B></CENTER><BR>
Some regular verbs change their spelling when the ending <B>ed</B> is added
to form the past participle.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3a"></A>
<B>a. Verbs ending in a silent e</B><BR>
When a regular verb ends in a silent <B>e</B>, only the letter <B>d</B> must be
added in order to form the past participle. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Infinitive</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Past Participle</B></U></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; to pleas<U>e</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; pleased</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to receiv<U>e</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; received</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>

<A NAME="3b"></A>
<B>b. Verbs ending in y</B><BR>
When a regular verb ends in <B>y</B> immediately preceded by a <U>consonant</U>,
the <B>y</B> is changed to <B>i</B> before the ending <B>ed</B> is added. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Infinitive</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Past Participle</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to stu<U>d</U>y</TD><TD>&nbsp; studied</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to re<U>l</U>y</TD><TD>&nbsp; relied</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to car<U>r</U>y</TD><TD>&nbsp; carried</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
However, when a regular verb ends in <B>y</B> immediately preceded by a <U>vowel</U>,
the <B>y</B> is <U>not</U> changed before the ending <B>ed</B> is added. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Infinitive</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Past Participle</B></U></TD></TR>

<B>c. Verbs ending in a single consonant preceded by a single vowel</B><BR>
The rules concerning the doubling of final consonants which apply when
adding the ending <B>ing</B> to form the present participle also apply when
adding the ending <B>ed</B> to form the past participle.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, when a one-syllable verb ends in a single consonant other than
<B>w</B>, <B>x</B> or <B>y</B> immediately preceded by a single vowel, the final
consonant must be doubled before the ending <B>ed</B> is added to form the
past participle. In the following examples, the consonants which have
been doubled are underlined. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Infinitive</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Past Participle</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to rub</TD><TD>&nbsp; ru<U>bb</U>ed</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to trim</TD><TD>&nbsp; tri<U>mm</U>ed</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to plan</TD><TD>&nbsp; pla<U>nn</U>ed</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to stop</TD><TD>&nbsp; sto<U>pp</U>ed</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
When a verb of more than one syllable ends in a single consonant other
than <B>w</B>, <B>x</B> or <B>y</B> immediately preceded by a single vowel, the final
consonant is doubled before the ending <B>ed</B> <U>only</U> when the last syllable
of the verb is pronounced with the heaviest stress. In the following
examples, the syllables pronounced with the heaviest stress are underlined. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Infinitive</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Past Participle</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to con<U>trol</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; controlled</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to in<U>fer</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; inferred</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to oc<U>cur</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; occurred</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to per<U>mit</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; permitted</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to <U>fas</U>ten</TD><TD>&nbsp; fastened</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to <U>or</U>der</TD><TD>&nbsp; ordered</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to <U>fo</U>cus</TD><TD>&nbsp; focused</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to <U>li</U>mit</TD><TD>&nbsp; limited</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
In the first four examples, the last syllable of the verb is pronounced
with the heaviest stress, and the final consonant is doubled before <B>ed</B> 
is added. In the last four examples, the first syllable of the verb is
pronounced with the heaviest stress, and the final consonant is not
doubled before <B>ed</B> is added.<BR>
<BR>
The final consonants <B>w</B>, <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> are never doubled when the ending
<B>ed</B> is added. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Infinitive</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Past Participle</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to <U>fol</U>low</TD><TD>&nbsp; followed</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to <U>box</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; boxed</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to por<U>tray</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; portrayed</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
It should also be noted that final consonants immediately preceded by
two vowels are not doubled when the ending <B>ed</B> is added. For example:<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 28-->

<A NAME="4"></A>
<CENTER><B>4. Pronunciation of the ed ending</B></CENTER><BR>
The ending <B>ed</B> is usually not pronounced as a separate syllable. For
instance, in each of the following examples, both the bare infinitive
and the past participle consist of one syllable. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Bare Infinitive</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Past Participle</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; puff</TD><TD>&nbsp; puffed</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; work</TD><TD>&nbsp; worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; miss</TD><TD>&nbsp; missed</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; watch</TD><TD>&nbsp; watched</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
However, when the ending <B>ed</B> is added to verbs which end in <B>d</B> or <B>t</B>,
the <B>ed</B> ending of the past participle is pronounced as a separate
syllable. The reason for this is that the sounds of <B>d</B> and <B>t</B> are
so similar to the sound of the <B>ed</B> ending, that the ending must be
pronounced as a separate syllable in order to be heard clearly.<BR>
<BR>
In each of the following examples, the bare infinitive consists of one
syllable; whereas the past participle consists of two syllables. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Bare Infinitive</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Past Participle</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; ad<U>d</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; add<B>ed</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; lan<U>d</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; land<B>ed</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; hun<U>t</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; hunt<B>ed</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; wai<U>t</U></TD><TD>&nbsp; wait<B>ed</B></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Similarly, when <B>d</B> is added to verbs ending in a silent <B>e</B> preceded
by <B>d</B> or <B>t</B>, the final <B>ed</B> of the past participle is pronounced as
a separate syllable. In each of the following examples, the bare
infinitive consists of one syllable; whereas the past participle
consists of two syllables. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Bare Infinitive</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Past Participle</B></U></TD></TR>

<CENTER><B>5. Formation of the present perfect: Irregular verbs</B></CENTER><BR>
In addition to <B>regular</B> English verbs, there are many <B>irregular</B> 
English verbs, which do not form the past participle with the ending
<B>ed</B>. The English irregular verbs are related to the <B>strong</B> verbs of
the German language. The following are examples of irregular English
verbs. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Bare Infinitive</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Past Participle</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; begin</TD><TD>&nbsp; begun</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; find</TD><TD>&nbsp; found</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; go</TD><TD>&nbsp; gone</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; let</TD><TD>&nbsp; let</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; take</TD><TD>&nbsp; taken</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
The past participles of irregular English verbs are formed in an
unpredictable manner, and must be memorized. A <A HREF="gramirr.html">table of common English
irregular verbs</A> is provided.<BR>
<BR>
Except for the irregularity of the past participle, the formation of the
Present Perfect tense is the same for an irregular verb as for a regular
verb. In both cases, the Simple Present of the auxiliary <B>to have</B> is
followed by the past participle of the verb.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, the irregular verb <B>to take</B> has the past participle
<B>taken</B>. Thus, the Present Perfect of the irregular verb <B>to take</B> is
conjugated as follows:<BR>
<BR><CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;I have taken</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;you have taken</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;he has taken</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;she has taken</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;it has taken</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;we have taken</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;they have taken</TD></TR>

&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="6"></A>
<CENTER><B>6. Questions and negative statements</B></CENTER><BR>
As is the case with other English tenses, questions and negative
statements in the Present Perfect are formed using the auxiliary. In
the case of the Present Perfect, the auxiliary is <B>have</B> or <B>has</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="6a"></A>
<B>a. Questions</B><BR>
In order to form a question, the auxiliary is placed before the subject
of the verb. For example:<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 30-->
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Question</B></U></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; You have worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Have you worked?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; He has worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Has he worked?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; She has worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Has she worked?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It has worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Has it worked?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; We have worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Have we worked?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They have worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Have they worked?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>

<A NAME="6b"></A>
<B>b. Negative statements</B><BR>
In order to form a negative statement, the word <B>not</B> is placed after
the auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Negative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I have worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; I have not worked.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; You have worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; You have not worked.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; He has worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; He has not worked.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; She has worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; She has not worked.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It has worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; It has not worked.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; We have worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; We have not worked.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They have worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They have not worked.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
<A NAME="6bha"></A>
The following contractions are often used in spoken English:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contractions</B></U></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; has not</TD><TD>&nbsp; hasn't</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>

<A NAME="6c"></A>
<B>c. Negative questions</B><BR>
In order to form a negative question, the auxiliary is placed before the
subject, and the word <B>not</B> is placed after the subject. However, when
contractions are used, the contracted form of <B>not</B> follows immediately
after the auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contractions</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Have I not worked?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Haven't I worked?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Have you not worked?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Haven't you worked?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Has he not worked?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Hasn't he worked?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Has she not worked?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Hasn't she worked?</TD></TR>

</TABLE>
<BR>
<A NAME="6d"></A>
<B>d. Tag questions</B><BR>
Tag questions are also formed using the auxiliary. In the following
examples, the negative tag questions are underlined.<BR>

<CENTER><B>7. The present perfect continuous</B></CENTER><BR>

<A NAME="7a"></A>
<B>a. Use</B><BR>
The Present Perfect Continuous tense is used to express continuous,
ongoing actions which have already been completed at the time of speaking
or writing.<BR>
<BR>
In the following example, the verb in the Present Perfect Continuous
tense is underlined.<BR>
e.g. The bus <U>has been waiting</U> for one hour.<BR>
<BR>
The use of the Present Perfect Continuous tense in this example indicates
that, at the time of speaking or writing, the bus has completed one hour
of continuous waiting.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="7b"></A>
<B>b. Formation</B><BR>
The Present Perfect Continuous tense of any English verb is formed from
the Present Perfect of <B>to be</B>, followed by the present participle of
the verb. For instance, the Present Perfect Continuous tense of the verb
<B>to work</B> is conjugated as follows:<BR>
<BR><CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;I have been working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;you have been working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;he has been working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;she has been working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;it has been working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;we have been working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;they have been working</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER><BR>
Thus, it can be seen that the Present Perfect Continuous tense has two
auxiliaries. The first auxiliary is <B>have</B> or <B>has</B>, and the second
auxiliary is <B>been</B>.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex04.html#8">Exercise 8</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="7c"></A>
<B>c. Questions and negative statements</B><BR>
When a verb has more than one auxiliary, it is the first auxiliary which
must change its form to agree with the subject of the verb. It is also
the first auxiliary which is used to form questions and negative statements.<BR>

<!--page 32-->
<BR>
<U>Questions</U> are formed by placing the first auxiliary before the subject
of the verb. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I have been working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Have I been working?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; You have been working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Have you been working?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; He has been working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Has he been working?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; She has been working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Has she been working?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It has been working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Has it been working?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; We have been working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Have we been working?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They have been working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Have they been working?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
<U>Negative statements</U> are formed by placing the word <B>not</B> after the first
auxiliary. For example:<BR>

<U>Negative questions</U> are formed by placing the first auxiliary before the
subject, and the word <B>not</B> after the subject. However, when contractions
are used, the contracted form of <B>not</B> follows immediately after the first
auxiliary. For example:<BR>
