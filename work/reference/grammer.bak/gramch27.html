<!--page 378-->
A phrasal verb is an idiom which consists of a verb followed by a
preposition, a verb followed by an adverb, or a verb followed by an
adverb, followed by a preposition. The phrasal verbs in the following
examples are printed in bold type.<BR>
e.g. I <B>ran into</B> an old friend.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We <B>put off</B> washing the dishes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They all <B>look up to</B> him.<BR>
<BR>
In these examples, the phrasal verb <B>to run into</B> consists of the verb <B>to run</B> followed by
the preposition <B>into</B>, the phrasal verb <B>to put off</B> consists of the verb
<B>to put</B> followed by the adverb <B>off</B>, and the phrasal verb <B>to look up to</B>
consists of the verb <B>to look</B> followed by the adverb <B>up</B>, followed by
the preposition <B>to</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Many phrasal verbs are used more often in informal English than in formal
English. In most cases, the ideas expressed by such phrasal verbs may also
be expressed by other phrases which are more likely to be used in formal
English.<BR>
<BR>
For instance in the table below, the phrasal verbs used in the preceding examples are listed
in the left-hand column and other phrases with the same meanings
are listed in the right-hand column.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<TR><TD>&nbsp; to put off</TD><TD>&nbsp to postpone</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; to look up to</TD><TD>&nbsp to admire</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
It should be noted that the use of many phrasal verbs varies among the
different dialects of English. For instance, in order to express the
idea of contacting someone by means of the telephone, the expression
<B>to ring someone up</B> is frequently used in British English; whereas the
expression <B>to call someone</B> is frequently used in American English.<BR>
<BR>
Because of differences in dialect, the forms of the verbs and the meanings
given may vary from one dictionary to another. In addition, some phrasal
verbs have more than one meaning. The meanings provided in this chapter
are samples of meanings which are used in North American English.

<CENTER><B>1. Phrasal verbs consisting of a verb followed by a preposition</B></CENTER><BR>

Some phrasal verbs consist of a verb followed by a preposition. As has
been seen in previous chapters, it is very common for English verbs
to be followed by prepositions. However, in the case of a phrasal verb,
the verb followed by the preposition forms an expression with an
idiomatic meaning.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 379-->
For instance, the phrasal verb <B>to come across</B> is an idiomatic expression
with the meaning <B>to find</B>. Similarly, the phrasal verb <B>to frown on</B> is
an idiomatic expression with the meaning <B>to disapprove of</B>.<BR>
e.g. We <B>came across</B> an old diary while we were cleaning out the attic.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The workers <B>frowned on</B> the practice of smoking in the office.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that some phrasal verbs consisting of a verb followed
by a preposition can be used in the Passive Voice.<BR>
e.g. The practice of smoking in the office <B>was frowned on</B> by the workers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The children <B>were looked after</B> by their aunt.<BR>
In these examples, the phrasal verbs <B>to frown on</B> and <B>to look after</B>
are used in the Passive Voice.<BR>

The following are examples of phrasal verbs which consist of a verb
followed by a preposition. Each phrasal verb is followed by its meaning and an example of its use.<BR>

<A NAME="1a"></A>
<B>a. The position of the object of the preposition</B><BR>
The object of a preposition usually follows the preposition, whether the
object is a noun or a pronoun. In the following examples, the objects are underlined.<BR>
e.g. We have <B>launched into</B> a new <U>project</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have <B>launched into</B> <U>it</U>.<BR>
<BR>
In these examples, the noun <B>project</B> and the pronoun <B>it</B> are the
objects of the preposition <B>into</B> of the phrasal verb <B>to launch into</B>.
Both the noun object and the pronoun object follow
the preposition.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex27.html#2">Exercise 2</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1b"></A>
<B>b. The position of an adverb of manner modifying the verb</B><BR>
If a verb is followed by a preposition, an adverb of manner may
be placed between the verb and the preposition. In the following examples, the adverbs of manner are underlined.<BR>
e.g. We <B>reasoned</B> <U>patiently</U> <B>with</B> the little girl.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I <B>leafed</B> <U>quickly</U> <B>through</B> the book.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the adverb of manner <B>patiently</B> is placed between
the verb <B>reasoned</B> and the preposition <B>with</B> of the phrasal verb <B>to
reason with</B>. In the second example, the adverb of manner <B>quickly</B> is
placed between the verb <B>leafed</B> and the preposition <B>through</B> of the
phrasal verb <B>to leaf through</B>.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex27.html#3">Exercise 3</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1c"></A>
<B>c. Stress in spoken English</B><BR>
When a verb followed by a preposition occurs at the end of a clause,
it is usually the verb which is stressed in spoken English. In the
following examples, the words which are stressed are printed in bold type.<BR>
e.g. No one likes to be <B>laughed</B> at.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I need someone to <B>confide</B> in.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the verb <B>laughed</B> followed by the preposition
<B>at</B> occurs at the end of a clause, and the verb <B>laughed</B> is stressed.
In the second example, the verb <B>confide</B> followed by the preposition
<B>in</B> occurs at the end of a clause, and the verb <B>confide</B> is stressed.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that, when used in a phrasal verb at the end of
a clause, the prepositions <B>after</B>, <B>into</B> and <B>over</B> are often
pronounced with somewhat greater emphasis than the verb. In this
case, both the verb and the preposition are stressed. For example:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The twins are easy to <B>look after</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The building would be difficult to <B>break into</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You'll never guess whom I <B>ran into</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I heard that someone was <B>run over</B>.<BR>
<BR>
The prepositions <B>above</B>, <B>across</B> and <B>through</B> are also occasionally
emphasized in this way. For example:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The research papers were difficult to <B>wade through</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<B>d. Expressions in which the verb has an object</B><BR>
In the case of some phrasal verbs consisting of a verb followed by a preposition,
the verb and the preposition may each have an object. In the following examples, the objects are underlined.<BR>
e.g. I can <B>make</B> <U>nothing</U> <B>of</B> the <U>situation</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We <B>talked</B> my <U>sister</U> <B>into</B> <U>agreeing</U>.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the verb <B>make</B> of the phrasal verb <B>to make of</B>
has the object <B>nothing</B>, and the preposition <B>of</B> has the object
<B>situation</B>. In the second example, the verb <B>talked</B> of the phrasal
verb <B>to talk into</B> has the object <B>sister</B>, and the preposition <B>into</B>
has the object <B>agreeing</B>.<BR>
<BR>
The following are examples of phrasal verbs consisting of a verb
followed by a preposition, where the verb may have an object. The objects of the verbs are underlined. Each phrasal verb is followed by its meaning and an example of its use. The last example illustrates the use of the Passive Voice.<BR>

<CENTER><B>2. Phrasal verbs consisting of a verb followed by an adverb</B></CENTER><BR>

Many phrasal verbs consist of a verb followed by an adverb. Some of
these phrasal verbs are intransitive and some are transitive.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, the intransitive phrasal verb <B>to show up</B> is formed from
the verb <B>to show</B> followed by the adverb <B>up</B>. In the following example, the phrasal verb does not have an object.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At ten o'clock, her brother <B>showed up</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="2vi"></A>
<BR>
The following are examples of intransitive phrasal verbs which consist
of a verb followed by an adverb. Each phrasal verb is followed by its meaning and an example of its use.<BR>

<B>a. The position of the object of the verb</B><BR>
In the case of transitive phrasal verbs consisting of a verb followed by
an adverb, if the object of the verb is a noun, the object can usually
either follow or precede the adverb. In the following examples, the objects are underlined.<BR>
e.g. I <B>called off</B> the <U>meeting</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I <B>called</B> the <U>meeting</U> <B>off</B>.<BR>
In the first example the object <B>meeting</B> follows the adverb <B>off</B>, while in
the second example the object <B>meeting</B> precedes the adverb <B>off</B>.<BR>
<BR>
However, in the case of a few phrasal verbs, a noun object must usually
<U>follow</U> the adverb.<BR>
e.g. We attempted to <B>smooth over</B> the <U>disagreement</U>.<BR>
In this example, the phrasal verb <B>to smooth over</B> is followed by the
noun object <B>disagreement</B>. In this case, the object <B>disagreement</B> cannot be placed
before the adverb <B>over</B>.<BR>
<BR>
The following are examples of transitive phrasal verbs where a noun
object must usually follow the adverb. Each phrasal verb is accompanied by its meaning and an example of its use. The objects of the verbs are underlined.<BR>

</TABLE><BR>
In the case of transitive phrasal verbs consisting of a verb followed by
an adverb, if the object of the verb is a pronoun, the object must usually
<U>precede</U> the adverb. In the following examples, the pronoun objects are underlined.<BR>
e.g. I <B>called</B> <U>it</U> <B>off</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We attempted to <B>smooth</B> <U>it</U> <B>over</B>.<BR>
In these examples, the pronoun object <B>it</B> precedes the adverbs <B>off</B> and <B>over</B>.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex27.html#6">Exercise 6</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Most transitive phrasal verbs may be used in the Passive Voice.<BR>
e.g. The meeting was <B>called off</B> by me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The disagreement was <B>smoothed over</B>.<BR>
In these examples, the phrasal verbs <B>to call off</B> and <B>to smooth over</B>
are used in the Passive Voice.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2b"></A>
<B>b. The position of an adverb of manner modifying the verb</B><BR>
In the case of a phrasal verb consisting of a verb followed by an
adverb, the verb and the adverb usually may <U>not</U> be separated by an
adverb of manner. In the following example, the adverb of manner is underlined.<BR>
e.g. I <U>hurriedly</U> <B>called off</B> the meeting.<BR>
In this example, the adverb of manner <B>hurriedly</B> precedes the phrasal
verb <B>called off</B>. The adverb <B>hurriedly</B> may also be placed at the
beginning or the end of the sentence, but may not be placed between the
verb <B>called</B> and the adverb <B>off</B>.<BR>

When a phrasal verb consisting of a verb followed by an adverb occurs at
the end of a clause, it is usually the adverb which is stressed in spoken
English. In the following examples, the words which are stressed are
printed ion bold type.<BR>
e.g. How did that come <B>about</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please drop <B>in</B> whenever you have time.<BR>
In the first example, the verb <B>come</B> followed by the adverb <B>about</B>
occurs at the end of a clause, and the adverb <B>about</B> is stressed.
In the second example, the verb <B>drop</B> followed by the adverb <B>in</B>
occurs at the end of a clause, and the adverb <B>in</B> is stressed.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2d"></A>
<B>d. Ergative verbs</B><BR>
It should be noted that there are a few phrasal verbs consisting of a
verb followed by an adverb, which have the same meaning whether they are
used transitively or intransitively. For example:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The engineer <B>slowed down</B> the <U>train</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The train <B>slowed down</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the phrasal verb <B>to slow down</B> is used transitively,
with the object <B>train</B>. In the second example, the phrasal verb <B>to slow
down</B> is used intransitively, without naming the originator of the action.
In these two examples, it can be seen that the object of the transitive
verb is the subject of the intransitive verb. However, the general meaning of the two sentences is the same. Verbs which can be used
in this way may be referred to as <B>ergative verbs</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="2dex"></A>
<BR>
The following are examples of expressions which can function as ergative
phrasal verbs. Each ergative phrasal verb is followed by its meaning and examples of its use.<BR>

<CENTER><B>3. Distinguishing between verbs followed by prepositions  and verbs followed by adverbs</B></CENTER><BR>

It has been seen that the position of pronoun objects, adverbs of manner and stress in spoken English
varies according to whether a verb is followed by a preposition or by
an adverb.<BR>
<BR>
These differences are summarized in the following table. The verbs <B>to sit</B> and <B>to turn</B> are used as examples. The verb <B>to sit</B> is followed by <B>on</B> used as a <U>preposition</U>, whereas the verb <B>to turn</B> is followed by <B>on</B> used as an <U>adverb</U>.<BR>
<BR>

<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

</TABLE><BR>
<BR>

Because of the differences summarized above, it is important to be
able to distinguish between a verb followed by a preposition, and a
verb followed by an adverb.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3a"></A>
<B>a. Adverb phrases of location compared with phrasal verbs followed by objects</B><BR>
In many cases, it is necessary to distinguish between an ordinary verb
followed by an adverb phrase of location, and a phrasal verb followed
by an object.<BR>
e.g. I turned <U>up the street</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I turned up the <U>volume</U>.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the verb <B>turned</B> is followed by the adverb phrase
of location <B>up the street</B>. In the second example, the phrasal verb
<B>turned up</B> is followed by the object <B>volume</B>. In this example, the
phrasal verb <B>turned up</B> has the meaning <B>increased</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 390-->
In the first example, <B>street</B> is the object of the preposition <B>up</B>.
If the object is changed to a pronoun, the pronoun must follow the
preposition:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I turned up the <U>street</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I turned up <U>it</U>.<BR>
<BR>
In the second example, <B>volume</B> is the object of the phrasal verb
<B>turned up</B>. If the object is changed to a pronoun, the pronoun must
precede the adverb <B>up</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I turned up the <U>volume</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I turned <U>it</U> up.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, if the verb is modified by an adverb of manner,
the adverb of manner may precede the adverb phrase of location:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I turned up the street.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I turned <U>quickly</U> up the street.<BR>
<BR>
In the second example, if the verb is modified by an adverb of manner,
the adverb of manner may <U>not</U> be placed between the two parts of the
phrasal verb:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I turned up the volume.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I <U>quickly</U> turned up the volume.<BR>
<BR>

<B>b. Words used as prepositions or adverbs</B><BR>
It is also necessary to be able to distinguish between a phrasal verb
consisting of a verb followed by a preposition, and a phrasal verb
consisting of a transitive verb followed by an adverb. In many cases
it is possible to make the distinction by means of the preposition or
adverb following the verb.<BR>
<BR>
For example, the following words are used in phrasal verbs as <U>prepositions</U>,
but are not usually used in phrasal verbs as adverbs following transitive
verbs:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="70%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; after</TD><TD>&nbsp; against</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; at</TD><TD>&nbsp; before</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; by</TD><TD>&nbsp; for</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; from</TD><TD>&nbsp; into</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; of</TD><TD>&nbsp; to</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; toward</TD><TD>&nbsp; with</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; without</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
In contrast, the following words are used in phrasal verbs as <U>adverbs</U> following transitive verbs, but are not usually used in phrasal verbs
as prepositions:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="70%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; along</TD><TD>&nbsp; aside</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; away</TD><TD>&nbsp; back</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; behind</TD><TD>&nbsp; down</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; forward</TD><TD>&nbsp; out</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; together</TD><TD>&nbsp; up</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<!--page 391-->
It should be noted that of these words, <B>aside</B>, <B>away</B>, <B>back</B>,
<B>forward</B>, <B>out</B> and <B>together</B> are usually <U>never</U> used as prepositions.
In contrast, the words <B>along</B>, <B>behind</B>, <B>down</B> and <B>up</B> are often used as
prepositions, but are not usually used as prepositions in phrasal verbs.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex27.html#9">Exercises 9</A> and <A HREF="gramex27.html#10">10</A>.<BR>
<A NAME="3bpa"></A>
<BR>
The following words present more difficulty, since they can be used in
phrasal verbs both as prepositions and as adverbs following transitive
verbs:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="70%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; across</TD><TD>&nbsp; around <B>or</B> round</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; through</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Thus, it is advisable to study which phrasal verbs use these words
as prepositions, and which phrasal verbs use these words as adverbs.
The following table gives examples of phrasal verbs containing each of
these words.
The left-hand column gives phrasal verbs consisting of verbs followed by
prepositions, while the right-hand column gives phrasal verbs consisting
of transitive verbs followed by adverbs.<BR>

<CENTER><B>4. Phrasal verbs consisting of a verb followed by a word which may function either as an adverb or as a preposition</B></CENTER><BR>

Some phrasal verbs consist of an intransitive verb followed by a word
which may function either as an adverb or as a preposition. For example:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We <B>passed by</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We <B>passed by</B> the <U>library</U>.<BR>
In the first example, the word <B>by</B> of the phrasal verb <B>passed by</B>
functions as an adverb. In the second example, the word <B>by</B> of the
phrasal verb <B>passed by</B> functions as a preposition which has the
object <B>library</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="4ex"></A>
<BR>
The following are examples of phrasal verbs which contain words which
may function either as adverbs or as prepositions. Each phrasal verb is followed by its meaning and examples of its use. The objects of the prepositions are underlined.<BR>
