= Release Notes

This version of English (v0.4.0) is the first step in a two part
process to scale the library back to it's "pure English" roots.
With limited exceptions, library scripts that are not strictly related
to providing routines for working with the English language will be
deprecated. Any useful deprecated functionality will to supported 
in Ruby Facets instead.

For the time being the RDocs are clearly marked as to which libraries
will be deprecated and when run a warning is thrown. With the next
version (0.5.0) these libraries will be removed and any final libs
to be deprecated will go through the same process for the following
version (0.6.0).
