* In the Simple Present and Simple Past tenses of the Active Voice,
the auxiliaries are used only for emphasis, and for the formation of
questions and negative statements. Auxiliaries are never used with
the Simple Present or Simple Past of the verb <B>to be</B>.
<P>
** When used without the auxiliary, the third person singular of the
Simple Present, in the Indicative Mood of the Active Voice, has the
ending <B>s</B>.
<P>
*** When used without the auxiliary, the Simple Past form of the verb is used. For regular verbs, and for many irregular verbs, the Simple Past has the same form as the past participle.
<P>
**** The other modal auxiliaries <B>could</B>, <B>may</B>, <B>might</B>, <B>must</B>, <B>should</B> and <B>would</B> form conjugations in the same way as <B>will</B> and <B>shall</B>.
