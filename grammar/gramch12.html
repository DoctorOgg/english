<CENTER><B>1. Use of the passive voice</B></CENTER><BR>

As explained in the preceding chapter, the Active Voice of a verb
is used when the subject of the verb refers to the person or thing
<U>performing</U> the action described by the verb.<BR>
<BR>
In contrast, the <B>Passive Voice</B> of a verb is used when the subject of the
verb refers to the person or thing <U>receiving</U> the action described by the
verb. Only a verb which can take an object can be put into the Passive
Voice.<BR>
<BR>
The Passive Voice is more commonly used in English than it is in other
European languages such as German or French. As well as being used in
everyday English, the Passive Voice is used extensively in official
documents and scientific papers.<BR>
<BR>
In the following examples, the verbs in the Passive Voice are underlined.<BR>
e.g. The ball <U>was struck</U> by the boy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gold <U>has been found</U> by the explorers.<BR>
In these examples, the verbs <B>was struck</B> and <B>has been found</B> are in
the Passive Voice. The subjects <B>ball</B> and <B>gold</B> refer to things
receiving the actions described by the verbs.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="2"></A>
<CENTER><B>2. Formation of the indicative mood of the passive voice</B></CENTER><BR>

For every tense in the Active Voice, there is a corresponding tense in
the Passive Voice. In the Passive Voice, the verb <B>to be</B> acts as an
auxiliary. The Passive Voice tenses of an English verb are formed from
the corresponding conjugations of <B>to be</B>, followed by the past participle
of the verb.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2a"></A>
<B>a. The simple present indicative</B><BR>
For instance, the Simple Present Indicative of <B>to be</B>, and the Simple
Present Indicative of the Passive Voice of the verb <B>to show</B> are
conjugated as follows:<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3"></A>
<CENTER><B>3. Questions and negative statements</B></CENTER><BR>

As is the case for other English conjugations, verbs in the Passive Voice
form questions and negative statements using the first auxiliary.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3a"></A>
<B>a. Questions</B><BR>
To form a question, the first auxiliary is placed before the subject. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>You were shown the sights.</TD><TD>Were you shown the sights?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>She is being shown the sights.</TD><TD>Is she being shown the sights?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>He will have been shown the sights.</TD><TD>Will he have been shown the sights?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>We should be shown the sights.</TD><TD>Should we be shown the sights?</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex12.html#1">Exercise 1</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3b"></A>
<B>b. Negative statements</B><BR>
To form a negative statement, the word <B>not</B> is placed after the first
auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B><U>Negative Statements</U></B><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You were not shown the sights.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She is not being shown the sights.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He will not have been shown the sights.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We should not be shown the sights.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex12.html#2">Exercise 2</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3c"></A>
<B>c. Negative questions</B><BR>
To form a negative question, the first auxiliary is placed before the
subject, and the word <B>not</B> is placed after the subject. However, when
contractions are used, the contracted form of <B>not</B> follows immediately
after the auxiliary. Contractions are often used in spoken English. For example:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U><B>Without Contractions</B></U><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were you not shown the sights?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is she not being shown the sights?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will he not have been shown the sights?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should we not be shown the sights?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B><U>With Contractions</U></B><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Weren't you shown the sights?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Isn't she being shown the sights?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Won't he have been shown the sights?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shouldn't we be shown the sights?<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER><B>4. Changing the voice of a verb</B></CENTER><BR>

When the verb of a sentence is changed from the Active Voice to the
Passive Voice and the other words in the sentence are left unaltered,
a change in meaning results. In the following examples, the verbs
are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <U>Active Voice</U>: He <U>is driving</U> to the airport.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Passive Voice</U>: He <U>is being driven</U> to the airport.<BR>
The person referred to by the subject of the first sentence is behaving
actively; the person is doing the driving. The person referred to by
the subject of the second sentence is behaving passively; someone else
is doing the driving.<BR>
<BR>
Using the first person singular of the verb <B>to show</B> as an example, the
following table compares the most commonly used tenses of the Indicative
Mood of the Passive Voice with the corresponding tenses of the Active Voice.<BR>

<CENTER><B>5. Changing the voice of a verb while preserving the meaning of a sentence</B></CENTER><BR>

In order to preserve the meaning of a sentence when the Voice of the
verb is changed, it is necessary to alter the order of the words in the
sentence.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5a"></A>
<B>a. Changing the verb from the active voice to the passive voice</B><BR>
When a verb which takes an object is changed from the Active Voice to
the Passive Voice, in order to preserve the meaning of the sentence, the
former object becomes the subject of the verb, and the former subject may
be preceded by the preposition <B>by</B>, and placed after the verb. In the
following examples, the verbs are underlined, and the direct objects of
the verbs are printed in bold type.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 139-->
For instance, in the sentence:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wind <U>is rippling</U> the <B>water</B>.<BR>
the verb
<B>is rippling</B> has the subject <B>wind</B> and takes the object <B>water</B>. When
the verb is put into the Passive Voice and the meaning of the sentence
is preserved, the former object, <B>water</B>, becomes the subject of the
verb, and the former subject, <B>wind</B>, becomes the object of the
preposition <B>by</B>, as follows:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The water <U>is being rippled</U> by the wind.<BR>
<BR>
Other examples are:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Active</U>: The squirrel <U>ate</U> the <B>nut</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Passive</U>: The nut <U>was eaten</U> by the squirrel.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Active</U>: The child <U>will open</U> the <B>parcel</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Passive</U>: The parcel <U>will be opened</U> by the child.<BR>
<BR>
In the first pair of examples, the verb <B>ate</B>, in the Active Voice, is
changed to <B>was eaten</B>, in the Passive Voice. In order to preserve the
meaning, <B>nut</B>, the object of the verb in the Active Voice, becomes the
subject of the verb in the Passive Voice, and is placed before the verb;
and <B>squirrel</B>, the subject of the verb in the Active Voice, becomes the
object of the preposition <B>by</B>, and is placed after the verb.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, in the second pair of examples, <B>parcel</B>, the object of the
verb in the Active Voice, becomes the subject of the verb in the Passive
Voice and is placed before the verb; and <B>child</B>, the subject of the
verb in the Active Voice, becomes the object of the preposition <B>by</B>,
and is placed after the verb.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex12.html#6">Exercise 6</A>.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that, when changing the Voice of a verb in a sentence
while preserving the meaning of the sentence, it is necessary to make sure
that the verb agrees with its new subject.<BR>
e.g. <U>Active</U>: The boys <U>are mowing</U> the <B>lawn</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Passive</U>: The lawn <U>is being mowed</U> by the boys.<BR>
<BR>
In the first sentence, the subject <B>boys</B> is plural; therefore a
plural auxiliary <B>are</B> is used. In the second sentence, the subject
<B>lawn</B> is singular; therefore a singular auxiliary <B>is</B> is used.
The agreement of verbs with noun subjects is discussed in the next
chapter.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5b"></A>
<B>b. Changing the verb from the passive voice to the active voice</B><BR>
When a verb is changed from the Passive Voice to the Active Voice, in
order to preserve the meaning of the sentence, the former subject
becomes the object of the verb, and, if the sentence includes a phrase
beginning with the preposition <B>by</B>, the former object of the preposition
becomes the subject of the verb.<BR>

<!--page 140-->
e.g. <U>Passive</U>: The clover <U>is being eaten</U> by the cow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Active</U>: The cow <U>is eating</U> the <B>clover</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In this pair of examples, the verb <B>is being eaten</B>, in the Passive
Voice, is changed to <B>is eating</B>, in the Active Voice. In order to
preserve the meaning of the sentence, <B>clover</B>, the subject of the
verb in the Passive Voice, becomes the object of the verb in the
Active Voice, and is placed after the verb; and <B>cow</B>, the object
of the preposition <B>by</B>, becomes the subject of the verb in the
Active Voice, and is placed before the verb.<BR>
<BR>
Other examples are:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Passive</U>: The wine <U>was ordered</U> by the dealer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Active</U>: The dealer <U>ordered</U> the <B>wine</B>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Passive</U>: The deer <U>could have been killed</U> by the poacher.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Active</U>: The poacher <U>could have killed</U> the <B>deer</B>.<BR>

<B>c. Changing the voice of a verb which takes both a direct object and an indirect object</B><BR>
When a verb in the Active Voice takes both a direct object and an
indirect object, either object can become the subject of the verb when
the verb is put into the Passive Voice, and the meaning of the sentence
is preserved. The object which does not become the subject remains as
an object. When a verb in the Passive Voice takes an indirect object,
the indirect object is usually preceded by a preposition.<BR>
e.g. <U>Active</U>: The guide <U>will show</U> you the <B>museum</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Passive</U>: You <U>will be shown</U> the <B>museum</B> by the guide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Passive</U>: The museum <U>will be shown</U> to you by the guide.<BR>
<BR>
In the first sentence, the verb <B>will show</B>, in the Active Voice, takes
the direct object <B>museum</B>, and the indirect object <B>you</B>. In the
second and third sentences, the verb <B>will be shown</B> is in the Passive
Voice, and the meaning has been preserved by altering the word order and
using the preposition <B>by</B>. In the second sentence, the former indirect
object, <B>you</B>, is the subject of the verb, and the former direct object,
<B>museum</B>, remains the direct object. In the third sentence, the former
direct object, <B>museum</B>, is the subject of the verb, and the former
indirect object, <B>you</B>, is preceded by the preposition <B>to</B>.<BR>
<BR>
A similar example is:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Active</U>: The policeman <U>gave</U> you a <B>medal</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Passive</U>: You <U>were given</U> a <B>medal</B> by the policeman.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Passive</U>: A medal <U>was given</U> to you by the policeman.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 141-->
In the first sentence, the verb <B>gave</B>, in the Active Voice, takes the
direct object <B>medal</B> and the indirect object <B>you</B>. In the second and
third sentences, the verb <B>was given</B> is in the Passive Voice. In the
second sentence, the former indirect object, <B>you</B>, is the subject of the
verb, and the former direct object, <B>medal</B>, remains the direct object.
In the third sentence, the former direct object, <B>medal</B>, is the subject
of the verb, and the former indirect object, <B>you</B>, is preceded by the
preposition <B>to</B>.<P>

<CENTER><B>6. The subjunctive mood of the passive voice</B></CENTER><BR>

The Passive Voice tenses discussed so far have all been in the Indicative
Mood. However, verbs in the Passive Voice can also be put into the
Subjunctive Mood.<BR>
<BR>
It has been seen that all of the tenses in the Passive Voice are formed
using auxiliaries. As has already been explained, the Subjunctive Mood
of tenses using auxiliaries is formed by putting the first auxiliary into
the Subjunctive Mood.<BR>
<BR>
Using the verb <B>to show</B> as an example, the following table illustrates
the formation of the tenses of the Subjunctive Mood of the Passive Voice.<BR>

<B>a. Use of the simple present subjunctive</B><BR>
Like the Simple Present Subjunctive of the Active Voice, the Simple
Present Subjunctive of the Passive Voice is often used in subordinate
clauses beginning with <B>that</B> in sentences which contain formal commands,
or requests.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 143-->
As can be seen from the preceding table, the Simple Present Subjunctive of
The Passive Voice is formed from the invariable auxiliary <B>be</B>, followed
by the past participle of the verb. The following sentences are examples
of the use of the Simple Present Subjunctive of the Passive Voice.<BR>
e.g. I request that he <U>be invited</U> to speak.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We asked that our suggestions <U>be considered</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They will insist that their colleague <U>be admitted</U> to the association.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex12.html#8">Exercise 8</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="6b"></A>
<B>b. Use of the past forms of the subjunctive</B><BR>
Like the past forms of the Subjunctive of the Active Voice, the past
forms of the Subjunctive of the Passive Voice are used in wishes, and in
statements containing false or improbable conditions.<BR>
e.g. I wish he <U>were allowed</U> to come.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would have been better if they <U>had been invited</U>.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the Simple Past Subjunctive of the Passive Voice,
<B>were allowed</B>, is used in expressing a wish. In the second example,
the Past Perfect Subjunctive of the Passive Voice, <B>had been invited</B>,
is used in expressing the false condition <B>they had been invited</B>.
