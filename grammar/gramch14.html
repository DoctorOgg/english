<A NAME="1"></A>
<CENTER><B>1. The use of determiners with singular countable nouns</B></CENTER><BR>

In English, singular countable nouns usually cannot be used alone; they must be preceded by a word such as <B>a</B>, <B>the</B>, <B>each</B> or <B>every</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>a</U> box<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>the</U> person<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>each</U> child<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>every</U> tree<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="1de"></A>
The words <B>a</B>, <B>the</B>, <B>each</B> and every</B> are examples of a group of
words which can be referred to as <B>determiners</B>. Such words, when used
together with nouns, help to determine to which particular entities the
nouns are referring. Determiners other than <B>a</B> and <B>the</B> are dealt
with in detail in a separate chapter.<BR>
<BR>
Singular countable nouns must usually be preceded by determiners even
when the nouns are also preceded by various descriptive words.<BR>
e.g. <U>a</U> heavy, awkward box<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>the</U> right person<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>each</U> young child<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>every</U> tall tree<BR>
<BR>
The meanings of the words <B>a</B> and <B>the</B> are less specific than the
meanings of the other determiners. <B>A</B> and <B>the</B> are sometimes referred
to as <B>articles</B>. They are the determiners most frequently used with
singular countable nouns.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="2"></A>
<CENTER><B>2. A and An</B></CENTER><BR>

The word <B>a</B> is often referred to as <B>the indefinite article</B>. The
indefinite article has two forms: <B>a</B> and <B>an</B>. The form <B>a</B> is used
before words which begin with a consonant sound.<BR>
e.g. a broom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a garage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a green apple<BR>
<BR>
As well as being used before words beginning with consonants, <B>a</B> is
also used before words which begin with vowels, but which are pronounced
with an initial consonant sound. For instance, <B>a</B> is used before words
beginning with <B>eu</B> and words beginning with a long <B>u</B>, since these
words are pronounced with an initial <B>y</B> sound. <B>A</B> is also used before
the word <B>one</B>, since <B>one</B> is pronounced with an initial <B>w</B> sound.<BR>
e.g. a euphonium<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a utensil<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a one-way street<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 159-->
As was mentioned in Chapter 3, a vowel followed by a single consonant,
followed by another vowel, is usually pronounced long. <B>A</B> is used before
the following words which begin with a long <B>u</B>:<BR>

<A NAME="2an"></A>
<BR>
The word <B>an</B> is used before words beginning with a vowel sound.<BR>
e.g. an apple<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an old broom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an umbrella<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an hour<BR>
<BR>
As well as being used before words beginning with vowels, <B>an</B> is also
used before the following words which begin with a silent <B>h</B>:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; heir<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; heirloom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; honest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; honorable<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; honorarium<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; honorary<BR>

&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="3"></A>
<CENTER><B>3. The use of A and An before singular countable nouns</B></CENTER><BR>
In many languages, the word for <B>a</B> is the same as the word for <B>one</B>.
This was also formerly the case in English. Because of the association
of <B>a</B> and <B>an</B> with the idea of <B>one</B>, <B>a</B> and <B>an</B> are usually used
only with singular countable nouns.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3a"></A>
<B>a. A weakened form of One</B><BR>
<B>A</B> or <B>an</B> frequently has the meaning of a weakened form of <B>one</B>.<BR>
e.g. I would like <U>a</U> cup of tea.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>A</U> car is parked in front of the house.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The child owns <U>a</U> bicycle.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3b"></A>
<B>b. Naming a profession</B><BR>
When a sentence such as the following is used to name someone's
profession, <B>a</B> or <B>an</B> must precede the name of the profession.<BR>
e.g. She is <U>an</U> artist.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is <U>a</U> student.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 160-->
<A NAME="3c"></A>
<B>c. Making a general statement</B><BR>
<B>A</B> is referred to as the <B>indefinite</B> article because it can be used to
refer to something in general terms. <B>A</B> and <B>an</B> are often used in
general statements.<BR>
e.g. <U>A</U> bank account can provide <U>a</U> good means of saving money.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>An</U> accountant must have <U>a</U> good knowledge of arithmetic.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>A</U> good pair of scissors should be used for cutting cloth.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3d"></A>
<B>d. Referring to something not mentioned before</B><BR>
In dialogue and descriptions, <B>a</B> and <B>an</B> are used with nouns that name
something which has not been referred to previously.<BR>
e.g. Where can I find <U>a</U> telephone?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly we heard <U>an</U> eerie sound.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All at once <U>a</U> moose appeared in front of us.<BR>
In these examples, it is assumed that the things referred to by the
nouns <B>telephone</B>, <B>sound</B> and <B>moose</B> have not been referred to
previously.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3e"></A>
<B>e. A or An with the meaning of Per</B><BR>
<B>A</B> or <B>an</B> can also be used with the meaning of <B>per</B>.<BR>
e.g. once <U>a</U> week<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; two dollars <U>a</U> dozen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; four times <U>a</U> year<BR>
In these examples, <B>a</B> has the meaning of <B>per</B>. For instance, <B>once a week</B>
means <B>once per week</B>, and <B>two dollars a dozen</B> means <B>two dollars per dozen</B>.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="4"></A>
<CENTER><B>4. The use of The before singular countable nouns</B></CENTER><BR>

The word <B>the</B> is often referred to as <B>the definite article</B>. The Old
English word from which <B>the</B> is derived was used as a demonstrative
pronoun, with a meaning similar to that of the modern English words
<B>this</B> and <B>that</B>. In modern English, the word <B>the</B> is usually used
with a noun when the speaker or writer feels that there will be no doubt
about which particular thing is meant.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4a"></A>
<B>a. Referring to something mentioned before</B><BR>
<B>The</B> is used with nouns referring to things previously mentioned.<BR>
e.g. Here is <U>the</U> book I mentioned to you last week.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I was walking to work I passed a garden. <U>The</U> garden was full of roses.<BR>
In the first example, <B>the</B> is used with <B>book</B>, because the book has
been mentioned previously. In the second example, the first time the
garden is referred to, the indefinite article <B>a</B> is used, because the
garden has not been mentioned previously. The second time the garden is
referred to, the definite article <B>the</B> is used, because the garden has
already been mentioned.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex14.html#2">Exercise 2</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 161-->
<A NAME="4b"></A>
<B>b. Referring to something unique</B><BR>
<B>The</B> is used when referring to things which are unique, since in such
cases there can be no doubt about which particular thing is meant.<BR>
e.g. I have found <U>the</U> answer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is <U>the</U> shortest route into town.<BR>
In the first example, <B>the</B> would be used if there is only one possible
answer. In the second example, <B>the</B> is used because only one route can
be the shortest one.<BR>
<BR>
Expressions such as <B>middle of</B> and <B>top of</B> are generally preceded by
<B>the</B>, since it is considered that there can, for example, be only one
middle or one top of something.<BR>
e.g. There is a car stopped in <U>the</U> middle of the road.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She is at <U>the</U> top of her class.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They like to be <U>the</U> center of attention.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The police are determined to get to <U>the</U> bottom of the mystery.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4c"></A>
<B>c. Referring to something when it is considered obvious what is meant</B><BR>
<B>The</B> is also used when, because the thing being referred to is the most
important one of its kind to the speaker or writer, it is assumed that
it will be understood which particular thing is meant.<BR>
e.g. <U>The</U> house needs to be painted.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>The</U> sun rose at six o'clock this morning.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm going to <U>the</U> park.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don't slam <U>the</U> door.<BR>
<BR>
These sentences give examples of the use of <B>the</B> to refer to things
which are not in fact unique, but which are uniquely important to the
speaker or writer. The expression <B>the house</B> is often used when
referring to one's own house. The expression <B>the sun</B> almost always
refers to the sun which is closest to the earth. The expression <B>the
park</B> might be used to refer to the only park in the vicinity, or to a
park which one visits often. In the sentence <B>Don't slam the door,</B> the
expression <B>the door</B> might refer to the door of the room or building
which one is presently occupying.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4d"></A>
<B>d. Referring to something as a class</B><BR>
When preceded by <B>the</B>, a singular countable noun can be used to
represent something as a class.<BR>
e.g. <U>The</U> telephone is a modern convenience.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>The</U> horse is a domesticated animal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>The</U> eagle is a bird of prey.<BR>
In the first example, <B>the telephone</B> refers to telephones considered as
a class. Likewise, in the other examples, <B>the horse</B> refers to horses
considered as a class, and <B>the eagle</B> refers to eagles considered as a
class.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that <B>the</B> is not used when the word <B>man</B> represents
the human race considered as a class.<BR>
e.g. <U>Man</U> has invented many things.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The dolphin may be as intelligent as <U>man</U>.<BR>
