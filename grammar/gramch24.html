<!--page 319-->
Words which are used to modify verbs or adjectives are usually referred
to as <B>adverbs</B>. For instance, the adverbs in the following sentences
are printed in bold type, and the words they modify are underlined.<BR>
e.g. I <B>often</B> <U>visit</U> the library.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is <B>surprisingly</B> <U>hot</U> today.<BR>
In the first example, the adverb <B>often</B> modifies the verb <B>visit</B>.
In the second example, the adverb <B>surprisingly</B> modifies the adjective <B>hot</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Words which are used to modify adverbs can also be referred to as
<B>adverbs</B>.<BR>
e.g. The train travels <B>very</B> <U>quickly</U>.<BR>
In this example, the adverb <B>very</B> modifies the adverb <B>quickly</B>.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="1"></A>
<CENTER><B>1. Adverbs which modify adjectives and other adverbs</B></CENTER><BR>

Adverbs which modify adjectives or other adverbs usually immediately
precede the words they modify.<BR>
e.g. The package is <B>extremely</B> <U>large</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We experienced <B>relatively</B> <U>few</U> difficulties.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Buses depart <B>quite</B> <U>regularly</U>.<BR>
In these examples, the underlined adverbs immediately precede the
words they modify. <B>Extremely</B> modifies the adjective <B>large</B>,
relatively</B> modifies the adjective <B>few</B>, and <B>quite</B> modifies the
adverb <B>regularly</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="1ae"></A>
<BR>
The adverbs <B>ago</B> and <B>enough</B> are exceptional, since they usually
follow the adjectives or adverbs they modify.<BR>
e.g. That happened <U>long</U> <B>ago</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is <U>old</U> <B>enough</B> to make his own decisions.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We ran <U>fast</U> <B>enough</B> to catch the bus.<BR>
In these examples, the adverbs <B>ago</B> and <B>enough</B> follow the words
they modify. <B>Ago</B> modifies the adverb <B>long</B>, and <B>enough</B> modifies
the adjective <B>old</B> and the adverb <B>fast</B>.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that in modern English, when <B>enough</B> is used as an
<U>adjective</U> modifying a noun, it precedes the noun. For instance, in the
following example, the adjective <B>enough</B> precedes the noun <B>apples</B>.<BR>
e.g. Do we have <B>enough</B> <U>apples</U> to make a pie?<BR>
<BR>
However, when <B>ago</B> is used with a noun, it follows the noun. For
instance, in the following example, <B>ago</B> follows the noun <B>months</B>.<BR>
e.g. That happened six <U>months</U> <B>ago</B>.<BR>
The reason for this may be found in the history of the word. <B>Ago</B>,
formerly spelled <B>agone</B>, was originally a past participle.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 320-->
<A NAME="1a"></A>
<B>a. Intensifiers</B><BR>
An adverb which is used to modify adjectives and adverbs, but which is
not usually used to modify verbs, can be referred to as an <B>intensifier</B>.
In the following examples, the intensifiers are printed in bold type.<BR>
e.g. I am <B>very</B> <U>happy</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The film was <B>quite</B> <U>good</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You did that <B>rather</B> <U>well</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Must you leave <B>so</B> <U>soon</U>?<BR>
In these examples, <B>very</B> modifies the adjective <B>happy</B>, <B>quite</B>
modifies the adjective <B>good</B>, <B>rather</B> modifies the adverb <B>well</B>, and <B>so</B> modifies the adverb <B>soon</B>.<BR>
<BR>
The following words are commonly used as intensifiers:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fairly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rather<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; too<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; very<BR>
<BR>
In addition, the word <B>really</B> is often used as an intensifier in
informal English.<BR>
e.g. The film was <B>really</B> <U>good</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You did that <B>really</B> <U>well</U>.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="2a"></A>
<B>a. Adverbs of frequency</B><BR>
Adverbs of frequency answer the question <B>How often?</B><BR>
<A NAME="2apo"></A>
<BR>
An adverb which modifies a verb may occupy one of three main positions
in a clause. These positions may be referred to as the beginning position,
the middle position, and the end position. Adverbs of frequency may
occupy any of these positions. In the following examples, the adverbs
of frequency are printed in bold type.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 321-->
An adverb in the <U>beginning position</U> is located at the beginning of a
clause. For example:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Often</B> the wind blows less strongly at night.<BR>
In this example, the adverb of frequency <B>often</B> is located at the
beginning of the clause.<BR>
<BR>
Most adverbs can occupy the beginning position in a clause. The use
of this position tends to emphasize the adverb.<BR>
<BR>
An adverb in the <U>end position</U> occurs after an intransitive verb,
or after the direct object of a transitive verb.<BR>
e.g. He <U>speaks</U> <B>seldom</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I visit <U>her</U> <B>frequently</B>.<BR>
In the first example, <B>seldom</B> follows the intransitive verb <B>speaks</B>.
In the second example, <B>frequently</B> follows the direct object <B>her</B> of
the transitive verb <B>visit</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Usually only one adverb at a time can occupy the beginning position or
the middle position in a clause. However, more than one adverb at a
time can occupy the end position in a clause.<BR>
<BR>
When more than one adverb occurs in the end position, the different
types of adverb are usually placed in a certain order. For instance,
in the end position, adverbs of frequency usually follow adverbs of
manner and adverbs of location, and precede adverbs of time and
adverbs of purpose.<BR>
<BR>
Adverbs of frequency which consist of single words most often occupy the
<U>middle position</U> of a clause. The location of adverbs in the middle
position varies depending on the type of verb used. Adverbs in the
middle position occupy the locations indicated below:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <B>1)</B> They follow the Simple Present and Simple Past of the verb <B>to be</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; <B>2)</B> They precede the Simple Present and Simple Past of verbs other than
the verb <B>to be</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; <B>3)</B> They follow the first auxiliary, in tenses which have auxiliaries.<BR>
&nbsp; <B>4)</B> They precede the first auxiliary, or the Simple Present or Simple
Past of the verb <B>to be</B>, in short answers.<BR>
<BR>
The following examples illustrate the use of adverbs of frequency in the
middle position of a clause. The relevant verbs are underlined.<BR>
&nbsp; <B>1)</B> We <U>are</U> <B>always</B> on time.<BR>
&nbsp; <B>2)</B> He <B>rarely</B> <U>makes</U> a mistake.<BR>
&nbsp; <B>3)</B> I <U>have</U> <B>often</B> <U>wondered</U> about that.<BR>
&nbsp; <B>4)</B> Have you seen this movie before? No, I <B>never</B> <U>have</U>.<BR>
In the preceding examples, <B>always</B> follows <B>are</B>, the Simple Present of
the verb <B>to be</B>; <B>rarely</B> precedes <B>makes</B>, the Simple Present of a verb
other than the verb <B>to be</B>; <B>often</B> follows the first auxiliary <B>have</B>
of the verb <B>have wondered</B>; and <B>never</B> precedes the auxiliary <B>have</B>
in the short answer <B>I never have</B>.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex24.html#1">Exercise 1</A>.<BR>
<A NAME="2ano"></A>
<BR>

<!--page 322-->
In negative statements, and negative questions with <B>not</B>, adverbs in
the middle position of a clause usually follow the word <B>not</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>Negative Statement</U>: They do <U>not</U> <B>often</B> miss the bus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Question with <B>Not</B></U>: Does he <U>not</U> <B>usually</B> know the answers?<BR>
In these examples, the adverbs <B>often</B> and <B>usually</B> follow the word <B>not</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In affirmative questions, and negative questions with <B>n't</B>, adverbs in
the middle position of a clause usually follow the subject of the clause. In the following examples, the subjects are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <U>Affirmative Question</U>: Is <U>it</U> <B>always</B> this cold in February?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Question with <B>n't</B></U>: Doesn't <U>he</U> <B>usually</B> know the answers?<BR>
In the first example, the adverb <B>always</B> follows the subject <B>it</B>. In
the second example, the adverb <B>usually</B> follows the subject <B>he</B>.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that the adverbs <B>daily</B>, <B>weekly</B>, <B>monthly</B>,
<B>yearly</B> and <B>annually</B> usually do <U>not</U> occupy the middle position of
a clause.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex24.html#2">Exercise 2</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Verbs may be modified not only by single-word adverbs, but also by adverb
phrases and clauses.
Like adverbs of frequency, adverb phrases and clauses of frequency answer
the question <B>How often?</B><BR>
<A NAME="2aap"></A>
<BR>
Adverb phrases and clauses of frequency usually occupy either the beginning
or end position of a clause.<BR>
e.g. <U>Once in a while</U>, I like to try something new.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We visited the museum <U>as often as we could</U>.<BR>
In the first example, the adverb phrase of frequency <B>once in a while</B>
occupies the beginning position of the clause <B>I like to try something
new</B>. In the second example, the adverb clause of frequency <B>as often as
we could</B> occupies the end position of the clause <B>We visited the museum</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="2aco"></A>
<BR>
It should be noted that except in the case of commonly used adverbs such
as <B>now</B>, <B>then</B> , <B>today</B>, <B>tomorrow</B>, <B>sometimes</B>, <B>usually</B>, <B>maybe</B>
and <B>perhaps</B>, adverbs and adverb phrases at the beginning of a clause
must usually be followed by commas. In the following examples, the commas
are underlined.<BR>
e.g. Unfortunately<U>,</U> it began to rain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As often as possible<U>,</U> we went outside for a walk.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2b"></A>
<B>b. Adverbs of time</B><BR>
Adverbs of time answer the question <B>When?</B><BR>
<BR>
Adverbs of time usually occupy either the beginning position or the end
position of a clause. In the following examples, the adverbs of time
are printed in bold type.<BR>
e.g. <B>Today</B> I will go to the library.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will go to the post office <B>tomorrow</B>.<BR>
In the first example, <B>today</B> occupies the beginning position of a clause.
In the second example, <B>tomorrow</B> occupies the end position of a clause.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 323-->
In the end position, adverbs of time usually follow adverbs of manner
and adverbs of location.<BR>
<BR>
With a few exceptions, such as <B>now</B>, <B>then</B> and <B>once</B>, most adverbs
of time may <U>not</U> occupy the middle position of a clause.<BR>
<BR>
The adverbs <B>now</B>, <B>then</B> and <B>once</B> may occupy any of the three
positions in a clause. For instance, in the following examples, <B>now</B>
occupies the first position, the middle position, and the end position
of a clause.<BR>
e.g. <B>Now</B> it is time to leave.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is <B>now</B> time to leave.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is time to leave <B>now</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="2bso"></A>
<BR>
It should be noted that <B>sometimes</B> is an adverb of frequency, whereas
<B>sometime</B> is an adverb of time.<BR>
e.g. I <B>sometimes</B> see him in the park.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would like to read that book <B>sometime</B>.<BR>
In the first example, the adverb of frequency <B>sometimes</B> occupies the
middle position of a clause. In the second example, the adverb of time
<B>sometime</B> occupies the end position of a clause.<BR>
<BR>
Adverb phrases and clauses of time usually occupy either the beginning
or end position of a clause.<BR>
e.g. <U>At nine o'clock</U>, the train will leave.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will call you <U>when I am ready</U>.<BR>
In the first example, the adverb phrase <B>at nine o'clock</B> occupies the
beginning position of the clause <B>the train will leave</B>. In the second
example, the adverb clause <B>when I am ready</B> occupies the end position of
the clause <B>I will call you</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2c"></A>
<B>c. Adverbs of manner</B><BR>
Adverbs of manner answer the question <B>How?</B> Many adverbs of manner
have the ending <B>ly</B>. The formation and use of adverbs of manner will
be discussed in more detail in the next chapter.<BR>
<BR>
Adverbs of manner most often occupy the end position of a clause, where
they follow an intransitive verb, or the direct object of a transitive
verb.<BR>
e.g. We waited <B>patiently</B> for the play to begin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I sold the strawberries <B>quickly</B>.<BR>
In the first example, the adverb of manner <B>patiently</B> follows the
intransitive verb <B>waited</B>. In the second example, the adverb of
manner <B>quickly</B> follows the direct object <B>strawberries</B> of the
transitive verb <B>sold</B>.<BR>
<BR>
An adverb of manner may be placed at the beginning of a clause, in order
to emphasize the idea expressed by the adverb.<BR>
e.g. <B>Patiently</B>, we waited for the show to begin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Quickly</B>, I sold the strawberries.<BR>
In these examples, the ideas expressed by <B>patiently</B> and <B>quickly</B> are
emphasized.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 324-->
Adverbs of manner are often placed in the middle position of a clause,
particularly when the clause contains no adverb of frequency.<BR>
e.g. I <B>slowly</B> <U>opened</U> the door.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I <U>have</U> <B>carefully</B> <U>considered</U> all of the possibilities.<BR>
In the first example, the adverb of manner <B>slowly</B> precedes <B>opened</B>, a
verb in the Simple Past. In the second example, the adverb of manner
<B>carefully</B> follows the auxiliary <B>have</B> of the verb <B>have considered</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="2csi"></A>
<BR>
In informal English, adverbs of manner are often placed immediately
after the word <B>to</B> of an infinitive. When this is done, the infinitive
is referred to as a <B>split infinitive</B>.<BR>
e.g. I wanted <U>to</U> <B>carefully</B> <U>consider</U> the situation.<BR>
In this example, the infinitive <B>to consider</B> is split by the adverb
<B>carefully</B>.<BR>
<BR>
However, in formal English, it is considered preferable not to use split
infinitives. In formal English, the above example could be written:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wanted <U>to consider</U> the situation <B>carefully</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Adverb phrases and clauses of manner usually occupy the end position of
a clause.<BR>
e.g. We arrived <U>on foot</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We finished the work <U>as quickly as we could</U>.<BR>
In the first example, the adverb phrase of manner <B>on foot</B> follows the
intransitive verb <B>arrived</B>. In the second example, the adverb clause
of manner <B>as quickly as we could</B> follows the direct object <B>work</B> of
the transitive verb <B>finished</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Adverb phrases and clauses of manner are sometimes placed at the beginning
of a clause, for emphasis. For example:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>As quickly as we could</U>, we finished the work.<BR>
In this example, the adverb clause <B>as quickly as we could</B> is emphasized.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2d"></A>
<B>d. Connecting adverbs</B><BR>
Adverbs such as <B>however</B>, <B>nevertheless</B> and <B>therefore</B> are often
used to connect the ideas expressed by the clauses in which they occur
to ideas expressed in previous clauses. In the following examples, the
connecting adverbs are printed in bold type.<BR>
<BR>
Connecting adverbs are often placed at the beginning of a clause. <BR>
e.g. I would like to go skiing. <B>However</B>, I have too much work to do.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was very busy; <B>nevertheless</B>, she found time to go swimming.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the adverb <B>however</B>, which occurs at the beginning
of the clause <B>I have too much work to do</B>, connects the idea expressed
in this clause with the idea expressed in the previous clause, <B>I would
like to go skiing</B>. In the second example, the adverb <B>nevertheless</B>,
which occurs at the beginning of the clause <B>she found time to go swimming</B>,
connects the idea expressed in this clause with the idea expressed in the
previous clause, <B>she was very busy</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 325-->
Many connecting adverbs may be placed in the middle position of a clause.
This is often done when the clause contains no adverb of frequency.
<BR>
e.g. I am, <B>nevertheless</B>, anxious to continue.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We <B>thus</B> had no difficulty finding the motel.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have, <B>therefore</B>, decided to do it.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, <B>nevertheless</B> follows <B>am</B>, the Simple Present
of the verb <B>to be</B>. In the second example, <B>thus</B> precedes <B>had</B>, the
Simple Past of a verb other than the verb <B>to be</B>. In the third example,
<B>therefore</B> follows the auxiliary <B>have</B> of the verb <B>have decided</B>.<BR>
<BR>
The adverb <B>however</B> may occupy any of the three positions in a clause.
As illustrated in the following examples, a connecting adverb is usually
separated by commas from the rest of the sentence.<BR>
e.g. <B>However</B>, it has stopped snowing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It has, <B>however</B>, stopped snowing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It has stopped snowing, <B>however</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="2din"></A>
<BR>
It should be noted that the adverb <B>instead</B> is often placed at the end
of a clause.<BR>
e.g. Because there was no meat, I bought fish <B>instead</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Connecting adverb phrases are most often placed at the beginning of a
clause. For example:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>As a result</U>, I decided to study hard.<BR>
In this example, the phrase <B>as a result</B> is placed at the beginning of
the clause <B>I decided to study hard</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="2dpo"></A>

the four different types of adverb discussed above.<BR>

<B>e. Adverb phrases and clauses of purpose</B><BR>
Adverb phrases and clauses of purpose answer the question <B>Why?</B> This
question is usually answered by a phrase or clause, rather than by a
single-word adverb. In the following examples, the adverb phrases and
clauses of purpose are underlined.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 326-->
Adverb phrases and clauses of purpose usually occupy the end position
of a clause, and follow any other adverbs, or adverb phrases or clauses.<BR>
e.g. I went to the store yesterday <U>to buy a coat</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I need to buy a new coat soon <U>because my old one is worn out</U>.<BR>
In the first example, the adverb phrase of purpose <B>to buy a coat</B>
occupies the end position of a clause, following the adverb of time
<B>yesterday</B>. In the second example, the adverb clause of purpose
<B>because my old one is worn out</B> occupies the end position of a clause, following the adverb of time <B>soon</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Adverb phrases or clauses of purpose are sometimes placed at the
beginning of a clause, for emphasis.<BR>
e.g. <U>To reach the airport on time</U>, we had to complete the trip in two
hours.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Because it was such a beautiful day</U>, I decided to go for a walk.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the adverb phrase of purpose <B>to reach the airport
on time</B> is placed at the beginning of the clause <B>we had to complete
the trip in two hours</B>. In the second example, the adverb clause
<B>because it was such a beautiful day</B> is placed at the beginning of
the clause <B>I decided to go for a walk</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2f"></A>
<B>f. Adverbs of location</B><BR>
Adverbs of location answer the question <B>Where?</B><BR>
<BR>
Adverbs of location, and adverb phrases and clauses of location, most
often occupy the end position of a clause, where they precede adverbs
of time and adverbs of purpose. In the following examples, the adverbs
and adverb phrases and clauses of location are underlined.<BR>
e.g. I am going <U>there</U> tomorrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He left his bicycle <U>in the driveway</U> last night.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know the office <U>where she works</U>.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the adverb of location <B>there</B> follows the verb
<B>am going</B>, and precedes the adverb of time <B>tomorrow</B>. In the second
example, the adverb phrase of location <B>in the driveway</B> follows the
object <B>bicycle</B> of the verb <B>left</B>, and precedes the adverb phrase of
time <B>last night</B>. In the third example, the adverb clause of location
<B>where she works</B> follows the object <B>office</B> of the verb <B>know</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="2fvm"></A>
<BR>
It should be noted that the position of adverbs and adverb phrases and
clauses of location relative to other types of adverb is affected by
whether or not the verb being modified is a <B>verb of motion</B>.<BR>
<BR>
A verb of motion is a verb which describes some type of movement. The
verbs <B>come</B>, <B>go</B>, <B>arrive</B>, <B>leave</B>, <B>walk</B>, <B>run</B> and <B>fly</B> are
examples of verbs of motion.<BR>
<A NAME="2for"></A>
<BR>

<!--page 327-->
If the verb of a clause is <U>not</U> a verb of motion, the most usual order
of the different types of adverb in the end position of a clause is
as follows:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adverb of Manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adverb of Location<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adverb of Time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adverb of Purpose<BR>
<BR>
The following example illustrates this order:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We waited</TD><TD>&nbsp; patiently</TD><TD>&nbsp; outside the theater</TD><TD>&nbsp; all afternoon</TD><TD>&nbsp; to buy tickets.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; <U>Type of Phrase</U>:</TD><TD>&nbsp; Manner</TD><TD>&nbsp; Location</TD><TD>&nbsp; Time</TD><TD>&nbsp; Purpose</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex24.html#4">Exercise 4</A>.<BR>
<BR>
The order may be varied if it is desired to emphasize one of the adverb
phrases. For instance, the adverb phrase of time <B>all afternoon</B> could
be given more emphasis by placing it immediately after the adverb
<B>patiently</B>, as follows:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We waited patiently <U>all afternoon</U> outside the theater to buy tickets.<BR>
<BR>
When the verb of a clause is a verb of motion, any adverb of location,
or adverb phrase or clause of location, is usually placed immediately
after the verb. The following table compares the position of adverbs
following verbs of motion with the position of adverbs following other
verbs.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>The most usual Position of Adverbs following a Verb</B></CENTER><BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Order of Adverbs following</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Order of Adverbs following a Verb</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><U><B>a Verb of Motion</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>which is not a Verb of Motion</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Adverb of Location</TD><TD>&nbsp; Adverb of Manner</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Adverb of Manner</TD><TD>&nbsp; Adverb of Location</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Adverb of Time</TD><TD>&nbsp; Adverb of Time</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Adverb of Purpose</TD><TD>&nbsp; Adverb of Purpose</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
It can be seen that the order of the adverbs following the two types of
verb is the same except for the relative order of the adverb of location
and the adverb of manner.<BR>
<BR>
The following example illustrates the most usual order of the four
different types of adverb phrase following a verb of motion:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will go</TD><TD>&nbsp; to the library</TD><TD>&nbsp; by bus</TD><TD>&nbsp; tomorrow</TD><TD>&nbsp; to return the book.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; <U>Type of Phrase</U>:</TD><TD>&nbsp; Location</TD><TD>&nbsp; Manner</TD><TD>&nbsp; Time</TD><TD>&nbsp; Purpose</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex24.html#5">Exercise 5</A>.<BR>


<!--page 328-->
Adverbs and adverb phrases and clauses of location are sometimes placed
at the beginning of a clause, for emphasis.<BR>
e.g. <U>Here</U>, the glacier deposited soil and rocks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>On the way to school</U>, she saw a robin building its nest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Wherever I look</U>, I see signs of spring.<BR>
In these examples, the adverb <B>here</B>, the adverb phrase <B>on the way to
school</B> and the adverb clause <B>wherever I look</B> are each placed at the
beginning of a clause.<BR>
<BR>
Adverbs of location usually cannot be placed in the middle position of a
clause.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2f1"></A>
<B>i. Here and There</B><BR>
The words <B>here</B> and <B>there</B>, indicating location,
are often used at the beginning of a clause, followed by the verb <B>to be</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In this construction, if the subject of the verb is a noun, the subject
<U>follows</U> the verb.<BR>
e.g. <B>Here</B> are the <U>tickets</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>There</B> was our <U>bus</U>.<BR>
In these examples, the noun subjects <B>tickets</B> and <B>bus</B> follow the
verbs <B>are</B> and <B>was</B>.<BR>
<BR>
However, if the subject of the verb is a <U>personal pronoun</U>, the subject
<U>precedes</U> the verb.<BR>
e.g. <B>Here</B> <U>they</U> are.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>There</B> <U>it</U> was.<BR>
In these examples, the personal pronoun subjects <B>they</B> and <B>it</B> precede
the verbs <B>are</B> and <B>was</B>.<BR>
<BR>
When the subject follows the verb, care must be taken to make sure that
the verb agrees with its subject.<BR>
e.g. <B>Here</B> is <U>one</U> of the examples.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>There</B> are <U>his aunt and uncle</U>.<BR>
In the first example, the verb <B>is</B> is singular to agree with the singular
subject <B>one</B>. In the second example, the verb <B>are</B> is plural to agree
with the plural subject <B>his aunt and uncle</B>.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex24.html#6">Exercise 6</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2f2"></A>
<B>ii. There used as an introductory word</B><BR>
In addition to being used to
indicate location, <B>there</B> can also be used as an introductory word, in
clauses indicating the existence of something. <B>There</B> as an introductory
word is often used with verbs such as <B>to be</B>, <B>to appear</B> and <B>to seem</B>. In the following examples, the verbs are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <B>There</B> <U>is</U> a public holiday on Monday.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>There</B> <U>are</U> three universities in the city.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>There</B> <U>seem</U> to be two possible answers to this question.<BR>
<BR>
In <U>affirmative statements</U> using this construction, the subject follows
the verb. In the following examples, the subjects are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <B>There</B> are only twenty-four <U>hours</U> in a day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>There</B> seems to be a <U>message</U> for you.<BR>
In the first example, the verb <B>are</B> is plural, to agree with the plural
subject <B>hours</B>. In the second example, the verb <B>seems</B> is singular,
to agree with the singular subject <B>message</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 329-->
In <U>questions</U> using this construction, <B>there</B> follows the verb in the case
of the Simple Present or Simple Past of the verb <B>to be</B>; otherwise, <B>there</B>
follows the first auxiliary. In the case of the Simple Present and Simple
Past of verbs other than the verb <B>to be</B>, the auxiliary <B>to do</B> must be
used. In the following examples, the verbs are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <U>Is</U> <B>there</B> a post office near here?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Were</U> <B>there</B> many people on the train?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Can</U> <B>there</B> <U>be</U> any doubt about it?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Do</U> <B>there</B> <U>seem</U> to be any maple trees in this forest?<BR>
In the first two examples, <B>there</B> follows <B>is</B> and <B>were</B>, the Simple
Present and Simple Past of the verb <B>to be</B>. In the last two examples,
<B>there</B> follows the first auxiliaries <B>can</B> and <B>do</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2f3"></A>
<B>iii. Inverted word order</B><BR>
When used with a verb of motion, an adverb or
adverb phrase of location may be placed at the beginning of a clause,
followed immediately by the verb, followed by the noun subject of the
verb. This construction is summarized below, followed by examples.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; adverb phrase</TD><TD>&nbsp; verb of</TD><TD>&nbsp; noun</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; of location &nbsp; &nbsp; +</TD><TD>&nbsp; motion &nbsp; &nbsp; +</TD><TD>&nbsp; subject</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Up the hill</TD><TD>&nbsp; trundled</TD><TD>&nbsp; the train.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Here</TD><TD>&nbsp; come</TD><TD>&nbsp; our friends.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
If the subject of the verb is a personal pronoun, the subject must
<U>precede</U> the verb, as illustrated below:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; adverb phrase</TD><TD>&nbsp; pronoun</TD><TD>&nbsp; verb of</TD></TR>

<A NAME="2g"></A>
<B>g. Negative adverbs</B><BR>
Negative adverbs include adverbs with an explicit negative meaning, such
as <B>never</B>, <B>not</B> and <B>nowhere</B>, as well as adverbs with an implied
negative meaning, such as <B>hardly</B>, <B>scarcely</B> and <B>seldom</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2g1"></A>
<B>i. Double negatives</B><BR>
In modern English, there is a rule that a clause
containing one negative word expresses a negative meaning, but a
clause containing two negative words expressed an affirmative meaning.
In the case of a clause with two negative words, it is considered that
one of these words negates the other, so that an affirmative meaning
results. The presence of two negative words in a clause is referred to as a <B>double
negative</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In some dialects of English, clauses containing two negative words may be
used to express a negative meaning.<BR>
e.g. I'm <U>not</U> saying <U>nothing</U> about it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He <U>never</U> told <U>nobody</U> the secret.<BR>
However, this use of the double negative is considered to be grammatically
incorrect in standard English.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 330-->
For each of the above examples, the double negative can be eliminated
by omitting or altering one of the negative words. Thus, the meaning
of the first example could be correctly expressed by either of the
following sentences:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm saying <B>nothing</B> about it. <B>or</B><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm <B>not</B> saying <B>anything</B> about it.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, the meaning of the second example could be correctly expressed by either of the following sentences:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He told <B>nobody</B> the secret. <B>or</B><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He <B>never</B> told <B>anybody</B> the secret.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex24.html#8">Exercise 8</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2g2"></A>
<B>ii. Inverted word order</B><BR>
If a clause begins with a negative adverb,
inverted word order must usually be used, with the subject following
the Simple Present or Simple Past of the verb <B>to be</B>, or the first
auxiliary. In the case of the Simple Present or Simple Past of any
verb other than the verb <B>to be</B>, the auxiliary <B>to do</B> must be used.
This construction is summarized below, followed by examples.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; Simple form of</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; negative adverb&nbsp; &nbsp; +</TD><TD>&nbsp; verb <B>to be</B> or&nbsp; &nbsp; +</TD><TD>&nbsp; subject</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; or adverb phrase</TD><TD>&nbsp; first auxiliary</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Never before</TD><TD>&nbsp; was</TD><TD>&nbsp; I</TD><TD>&nbsp; so eager to reach home.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Little</TD><TD>&nbsp; did</TD><TD>&nbsp; we</TD><TD>&nbsp; think we would meet again.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Seldom</TD><TD>&nbsp; had</TD><TD>&nbsp; they</TD><TD>&nbsp; tasted such a delicacy.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Following are other examples of this type of construction. The negative adverbs and adverb phrases are printed in bold type, and the subjects of the verbs are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <B>Seldom</B> was <U>he</U> at a loss for words.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Scarcely</B> had <U>we</U> left the house, when it began to rain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Not for many years</B> was the true <U>story</U> known.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>No sooner</B> did the <U>bell</U> ring than the children ran out of the school.<BR>
In the first example, the subject <B>he</B> follows <B>was</B>, the Simple Past of
the verb <B>to be</B>. In the succeeding examples, the subjects <B>we</B>, <B>story</B> and <B>bell</B> follow the auxiliaries <B>had</B>, <B>was</B> and <B>did</B>, respectively.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex24.html#9">Exercise 9</A>.<BR>
<BR>
In this type of inverted construction, if <B>there</B> is used as an introductory
word, <B>there</B> follows the Simple Past or Simple Present of the verb <B>to be</B>,
or the first auxiliary.<BR>
e.g. <B>Seldom</B> were <U>there</U> more than five ducks on the pond.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Rarely</B> had <U>there</U> been more swans on the lake than there were that day.<BR>
In the first example, <B>there</B> follows <B>were</B>, the Simple Past of the
verb <B>to be</B>. In the second example, <B>there</B> follows the auxiliary <B>had</B>, of the verb <B>had been</B>.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that the expression <B>so ... that</B> can also be used
with inverted word order.<BR>
e.g. <B>So</B> exhausted were <U>we</U> <B>that</B> we fell asleep at the table.<BR>
In this example, the subject <B>we</B> follows the verb <B>were</B>.

<A NAME="3"></A>
<CENTER><B>3. Interrogative adverbs</B></CENTER><BR>

The adverbs <B>how</B>, <B>when</B>, <B>where</B> and <B>why</B> can be used as interrogative
adverbs at the beginning of direct questions. The interrogative adverbs
in the following direct questions are printed in bold type.<BR>
e.g. <B>How</B> are you?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>When</B> is he coming?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Where</B> were you?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Why</B> did you say that?<BR>
<BR>
As shown in these examples, inverted word order must be used, with the
subject following the Simple Past or Simple Present of the verb <B>to be</B>,
or the first auxiliary. In the case of the Simple Present and Simple
Past of verbs other than the verb <B>to be</B>, the auxiliary <B>to do</B> must
be used. In the following examples, the subjects are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <B>How</B> is your <U>sister</U>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>When</B> did <U>you</U> see him?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Where</B> is <U>she</U> going?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Why</B> has <U>he</U> changed his mind?<BR>
<BR>
In these examples, the subject <B>sister</B> follows the verb <B>is</B>, and the
subjects <B>you</B>, <B>she</B> and <B>he</B> follow the auxiliaries <B>did</B>, <B>is</B> and
<B>has</B>, respectively.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex24.html#10">Exercise 10</A>.<BR>
<BR>
As well as being used as interrogative adjectives at the beginning of
direct questions, <B>how</B>, <B>when</B>, <B>where</B> and <B>why</B> can also be used at
the beginning of subordinate clauses. In the following examples, the
subordinate clauses are underlined.<BR>
e.g. Be ready to start <U>when you hear the signal</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He camped close to <U>where the brook flows into the lake</U>.<BR>
In the first example, <B>when you hear the signal</B> is an adverb clause of
time. In the second example, <B>where the brook flows into the lake</B> is
an adverb clause of location.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to being used at the beginning of adverb clauses, <B>how</B>, <B>when</B>,
<B>where</B> and <B>why</B> can also be used at the beginning of indirect questions.
In the following examples, the indirect questions are underlined.<BR>
e.g. I want to know <U>how he did that</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wonder <U>when they will arrive</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please tell me <U>where the school is</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will ask <U>why she left early</U>.<BR>
<BR>
As pointed out previously, inverted word order is not used in indirect
questions. Thus, the subject of an indirect question precedes the verb. In the following examples, the subjects are underlined.<BR>
e.g. We should find out <B>how</B> the <U>information</U> was transmitted.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ask her <B>when</B> <U>she</U> will be here.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wonder <B>where</B> <U>they</U> are.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please find out <B>why</B> <U>he</U> could not come with us.<BR>
In these examples, the subjects <B>information</B>, <B>she</B>, <B>they</B> and <B>he</B>
precede the verbs <B>was transmitted</B>, <B>will be</B>, <B>are</B> and <B>could come</B>.<BR>
