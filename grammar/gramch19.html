<CENTER><B>1. Indefinite pronouns</B></CENTER><BR>

Indefinite pronouns may be used without antecedents. The indefinite
pronouns in the following sentences are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <U>One</U> cannot believe everything <U>one</U> hears.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will try to think of <U>something</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Nobody</U> will believe it!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is there <U>anyone</U> here by the name of Smith?<BR>
<BR>
The following are examples of indefinite pronouns:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; one</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; anyone</TD><TD>&nbsp; anybody</TD><TD>&nbsp; anything</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; everyone</TD><TD>&nbsp; everybody</TD><TD>&nbsp; everything</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; [no one]</TD><TD>&nbsp; nobody</TD><TD>&nbsp; nothing</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; someone</TD><TD>&nbsp; somebody</TD><TD>&nbsp; something</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
All of the pronouns listed above take verbs in the third person singular.
The phrase <B>no one</B> is used like the other indefinite pronouns, but is
spelled as two separate words.<BR>
<BR>
The pronoun <B>one</B> can refer to persons or things.<BR>
e.g. <U>One</U> of the boys will help you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please hand me <U>one</U> of the boxes.<BR>
<BR>
However, when used in a general sense, the pronoun <B>one</B> is usually
understood as referring to persons.<BR>
e.g. <U>One</U> should always look both ways before crossing the street.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, the other indefinite pronouns ending in <B>one</B>, and the
indefinite pronouns ending in <B>body</B>, generally refer to persons. The
indefinite pronouns ending in <B>thing</B> generally refer to things.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike most of the personal pronouns, the indefinite pronouns have the
same form in the objective case as in the subjective case. As shown in
the following table, the indefinite pronouns which refer to persons form
possessive adjectives by adding <B>'s</B>.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Indefinite Pronoun</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Possessive Adjective</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; one</TD><TD>&nbsp; one's</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; anyone</TD><TD>&nbsp; anyone's</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; everyone</TD><TD>&nbsp; everyone's</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; no one</TD><TD>&nbsp; no one's</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; someone</TD><TD>&nbsp; someone's</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; anybody</TD><TD>&nbsp; anybody's</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; everybody</TD><TD>&nbsp; everybody's</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; nobody</TD><TD>&nbsp; nobody's</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; somebody</TD><TD>&nbsp; somebody's</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>

<!--page 212-->
The indefinite pronouns which refer to things usually do not form
possessive adjectives.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1a"></A>
<B>a. The use of One in general statements</B><BR>
The indefinite pronoun <B>one</B> is used in formal English to make general
statements.<BR>
e.g. By working systematically, <U>one</U> may achieve the results <U>one</U> desires.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In legal matters, <U>one</U> must always make sure of <U>one's</U> facts.<BR>
<BR>
When used in this way, <B>one</B> refers to persons in general, and has the
reflexive form <B>oneself</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>One</U> should prepare <U>oneself</U> to deal with any emergency.<BR>
<BR>
In informal English, the personal pronoun <B>you</B> is usually used in
making general statements. Thus, in informal English, the ideas in the
above sentences might be expressed:<BR>
e.g. By working systematically, <U>you</U> may achieve the results <U>you</U> desire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In legal matters, <U>you</U> must always make sure of <U>your</U> facts.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>You</U> should prepare <U>yourself</U> to deal with any emergency.<BR>
<BR>
Occasionally, the pronoun <B>we</B> is used in general statements. This use
of the pronoun <B>we</B> is most likely to occur in formal speeches.<BR>
e.g. By working systematically, <U>we</U> may achieve the results <U>we</U> desire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In legal matters, <U>we</U> must always make sure of <U>our</U> facts.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>We</U> should prepare <U>ourselves</U> to deal with any emergency.<BR>
<BR>
It is considered grammatically incorrect to use more than one type of
pronoun in a general statement such as those given above. For instance,
if a general statement is begun using the pronoun <B>one</B>, the pronoun <B>one</B> must be used throughout the statement. As shown above, the possessive
adjectives and reflexive pronouns in a general statement must agree with
their antecedents.<BR>

the indefinite pronoun <B>one</B>.<BR>

<A NAME="1ath"></A>
<BR>

<!--page 213-->
In formal English, it is considered grammatically correct to use the
adjective <B>his</B> to agree with indefinite pronouns such as <B>anyone</B> and <B>everyone</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>Everyone</U> took <U>his</U> seat.<BR>
<BR>
However, it is considered less discriminatory to use a phrase such as
<B>his or her</B> to agree with such pronouns.<BR>
e.g. <U>Everyone</U> took <U>his or her</U> seat.<BR>
<BR>
In informal English, the problem of gender is often avoided by the use
of the plural adjective <B>their</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>Everyone</U> took <U>their</U> seat.<BR>
However, this use of <B>their</B> is considered to be grammatically incorrect
in formal English.<P>

<A NAME="2"></A>
<CENTER><B>2. Reciprocal pronouns</B></CENTER><BR>

Reciprocal pronouns refer to persons or things which are acting on each
other. In English, the following two phrases are used as reciprocal
pronouns:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each other<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one another<BR>
<BR>
Both phrases may be used to refer to either persons or things.<BR>
e.g. You and I saw <U>each other</U> last week.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The houses faced <U>each other</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The two friends helped <U>one another</U> with their work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wires were touching <U>one another</U>.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="3"></A>
<CENTER><B>3. Demonstrative pronouns</B></CENTER><BR>

The words <B>this</B>, <B>that</B>, <B>these</B> and <B>those</B> are used to indicate
specific persons or things. In the following examples, the words
<B>this</B>, <B>that</B>, <B>these</B> and <B>those</B> are used independently, and can
be referred to as <B>demonstrative pronouns</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>This</U> is an apple pie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>That</U> is a good idea.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>These</U> are my friends.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Those</U> are maple trees.<BR>
<BR>
The words <B>this</B>, <B>that</B>, <B>these</B> and <B>those</B> can also be used
immediately preceding a noun, in which case they can be referred to
as <B>demonstrative adjectives</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>This</U> pie is made with apples.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>That</U> idea seems practical.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>These</U> people are my friends.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Those</U> trees are maples.<BR>

<!--page 214-->
In the preceding examples, <B>this</B>, <B>that</B>, <B>these</B> and <B>those</B> act as
adjectives, modifying the nouns <B>pie</B>, <B>idea</B>, <B>people</B> and <B>trees</B>,
respectively.<BR>
<BR>
<B>This</B> and <B>these</B> are used to indicate persons or things that are
close to the speaker or writer. <B>This</B> takes a singular verb, and is
used when referring to a single person or thing.<BR>
e.g. <U>This</U> is my brother.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>This</U> book belongs to him.<BR>
<BR>
<B>These</B> takes a plural verb, and is used when referring to more than one
person or thing.<BR>
e.g. <U>These</U> are my brothers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>These</U> books belong to him.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex19.html#2">Exercise 2</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<B>That</B> and <B>those</B> are used to indicate persons or things that are at
a distance from the speaker or writer. <B>That</B> takes a singular verb,
and is used when referring to a single person or thing.<BR>
e.g. <U>That</U> is a computer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>That</U> woman is a professor.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Those</B> takes a plural verb, and is used when referring to more than one
person or thing.<BR>
e.g. <U>Those</U> are computers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Those</U> women are professors.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex19.html#3">Exercise 3</A>.<BR>

The use of <B>this</B>, <B>these</B>, <B>that</B> and <B>those</B> is summarized in the

<CENTER><B>4. Interrogative pronouns</B></CENTER><BR>

Interrogative pronouns are used in asking questions. The pronouns
<B>who</B>, <B>what</B> and <B>which</B> are used as interrogative pronouns.<BR>
e.g. <U>Who</U> telephoned?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>What</U> did you say?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Which</U> is your brother?<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 215-->
<A NAME="4a"></A>
<B>a. Direct questions</B><BR>
Interrogative pronouns can be placed at the beginning of a sentence in
order to ask a question. Such questions can be referred to as <B>direct questions</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In a direct question, when the interrogative pronoun is the <U>subject</U> of a
verb, the verb follows the subject. In the following examples, the verbs
are underlined, and the subjects of the verbs are printed in bold type.<BR>
e.g. <B>What</B> <U>has happened</U>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Who</B> <U>has been invited</U>?<BR>
In these examples, <B>what</B> is the subject of the verb <B>has happened</B>,
and <B>who</B> is the subject of the verb <B>has been invited</B>. The presence
of the interrogative pronoun transforms the statement into a question,
and a question mark must be used.<BR>
<BR>
When the interrogative pronoun is the <U>object</U> of the verb or the object of
a preposition, inverted word order must be used, with the first auxiliary
preceding the subject of the verb. In the case of verbs in the Simple
Present or Simple Past, the auxiliary <B>do</B> or <B>did</B> must be used.<BR>
e.g. What <U>do</U> <B>you</B> <U>mean</U>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which <U>did</U> <B>she</B> <U>choose</U>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What <U>is</U> <B>he</B> <U>doing</U>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To what <U>can</U> <B>one</B> <U>attribute</U> their success?<BR>
<BR>
In the preceding examples, the subjects <B>you</B>, <B>she</B>, <B>he</B> and <B>one</B> are
preceded by the auxiliaries <B>do</B>, <B>did</B>, <B>is</B> and <B>can</B>. In the first
three examples, <B>what</B> and <B>which</B> are the objects of the verbs. In the
fourth example, <B>what</B> is the object of the preposition <B>to</B>.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex19.html#6">Exercise 6</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4b"></A>
<B>b. The pronoun Who</B><BR>
The pronoun <B>who</B> usually refers only to persons. Unlike the other
interrogative pronouns, <B>who</B> changes its form depending on the case,
as shown in the following table.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Subjective Case</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Objective Case</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Possessive Case</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; who</TD><TD>&nbsp; whom</TD><TD>&nbsp; whose</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>

<A NAME="4b1"></A>
<B>i. Who</B><BR>
When <B>who</B> is the subject of a verb, the subjective case must
be used.<BR>
e.g. <B>Who</B> <U>opened</U> the door?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Who</B> <U>will help</U> me?<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that when <B>who</B> is used with the verb <B>to be</B>, or
with verbs in the Passive Voice, the subjective case must usually be
used, since such verbs cannot take an object.<BR>
e.g. <B>Who</B> <U>is</U> it?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Who</B> <U>was</U> the fastest runner?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Who</B> <U>will be</U> there?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Who</B> <U>has been elected</U>?<BR>
The first three examples above illustrate the use of <B>who</B> with the verb
<B>to be</B>. The fourth example illustrates the use of <B>who</B> with a verb in
the Passive Voice.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 216-->
<A NAME="4b2"></A>
<B>ii. Whom</B><BR>
In formal English, when the pronoun <B>who</B> is the object of
a verb or the object of a preposition, the objective form <B>whom</B> must
be used.<BR>
e.g. <U>Whom</U> did you see downtown?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To <U>whom</U> did you send the invitations?<BR>
In the first example, <B>whom</B> is the object of the verb <B>see</B>. In the
second example, <B>whom</B> is the object of the preposition <B>to</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In informal English, the form <B>who</B> is often used for the objective as
well as for the subjective case. For instance, in informal English, the
preceding examples might be expressed <B>Who did you see downtown?</B> and
<B>Who did you send the invitations to?</B> However, this use of <B>who</B> is
considered to be grammatically incorrect in formal English.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex19.html#7">Exercise 7</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4b3"></A>
<B>iii. Whose</B><BR>
The form <B>whose</B> can be used either as a possessive
adjective followed by a noun, or as a possessive pronoun.<BR>
e.g. <U>Whose</U> books are these?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Whose</U> are these?<BR>
In the first example, <B>whose</B> is used as a possessive adjective,
followed by the noun <B>books</B>. In the second example, <B>whose</B> is
used as a possessive pronoun.<BR>
<BR>
The possessive form <B>whose</B> expresses the idea of <B>belonging to</B>. For
instance, the idea expressed in the sentence: <B>Whose books are these?</B>
could also be expressed by the sentence: <B>To whom do these books belong?</B><BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex19.html#8">Exercise 8</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4c"></A>
<B>c. What and Which</B><BR>
<B>What</B> and <B>which</B> can be used either as interrogative pronouns, or as
interrogative adjectives followed by nouns.<BR>
e.g. <U>What</U> is that?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Which</U> is his sister?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>What</U> time is it?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Which</U> woman is his sister?<BR>
In the first two examples, <B>what</B> and <B>which</B> are used as interrogative
pronouns. In the last two examples, <B>what</B> and <B>which</B> are used as
interrogative adjectives preceding the nouns <B>time</B> and <B>woman</B>.<BR>
<BR>
When used as adjectives or as interrogative pronouns, <B>what</B> and <B>which</B>
can refer to either persons or things. In the following examples, <B>what</B>
and <B>which</B> are used as interrogative adjectives referring to
persons and things.<BR>
e.g. <U>What</U> girl would not like to own a horse?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>What</U> color are the apples?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Which</U> boy is the best horseback rider?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Which</U> road leads to Chicago?<BR>
<BR>
However, it should be noted that when used as a relative pronoun, <B>which</B>
can refer only to things. Relative pronouns will be discussed later in
this chapter.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 217-->
<B>Which</B> as an adjective or interrogative pronoun usually implies a choice
of one or more things from a limited number of alternatives.<BR>
e.g. <U>Which</U> apple would you like?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Which</U> children were ready on time?<BR>
The first example implies a choice of one apple from two or more apples.
The second example implies that an answer is expected which will indicate
certain children from a limited group of children.<BR>
<BR>
In contrast, <B>what</B> as an adjective or interrogative pronoun is usually
used in order to ask for general information.<BR>
e.g. <U>What</U> time is it?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>What</U> does he want?<BR>
<BR>
<B>What</B> can also be used in exclamations. For instance, the exclamation
<B>What!</B> can be used to express surprise or disbelief. The following are
other examples of the use of <B>what</B> in exclamations.<BR>
e.g. What nonsense!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What a shame!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What a beautiful day!<BR>
In written English, an exclamation must be followed by an exclamation
mark: <B>!</B>&nbsp; It should be noted that exclamations often do not contain verbs.<BR>
<BR>
As illustrated above, when an exclamatory <B>what</B> precedes a singular,
countable noun, the word <B>what</B> must be followed by <B>a</B> or <B>an</B>.<BR>
e.g. What <U>a</U> coincidence!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What <U>an</U> elegant dress!<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex19.html#9">Exercise 9</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4d"></A>
<B>d. Indirect questions</B><BR>
As well as being used at the beginning of direct questions, interrogative
pronouns and adjectives can also be used at the beginning of <B>indirect</B> questions.<BR>
<BR>
Whereas a direct question forms a complete sentence in itself, an indirect
question is part of a longer sentence. The following examples show
the difference between a direct question and an indirect question.<BR>
e.g. <U>Who is there</U>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He wants to know <U>who is there</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will you tell me <U>who is there</U>?<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, <B>Who is there?</B> is a direct question. In the
second example, <B>who is there</B> is an indirect question which is part
of a longer statement. In the third example, <B>who is there</B> is an
indirect question which is part of a longer question.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4d1"></A>
<B>i. Interrogative word as the subject</B><BR>
When the interrogative word is the
subject of a verb, or modifies the subject of a verb, the word order of
an indirect question is usually the same as that of a direct question. 
In the following examples, the verbs of the direct and indirect questions
are underlined, and their subjects are printed in bold type.<BR>
e.g. <U>Direct Question</U>: <B>What</B> <U>has happened?</U><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: We shall ask <B>what</B> <U>has happened</U>.<BR>
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: Which <B>child</B> <U>won</U> the race?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: They will ask which <B>child</B> <U>won</U> the race.<BR>
<BR>
In the first pair of examples, the interrogative pronoun <B>what</B> is the
subject of the verb <B>has happened</B>. In the second pair of examples, the
interrogative adjective <B>which</B> modifies <B>child</B>, the subject of the
verb <B>won</B>. In both pairs of examples, the word order of the indirect
questions is the same as that of the direct questions.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4d2"></A>
<B>ii. Interrogative word as the object of a verb or preposition</B><BR>
When the
interrogative word is the object of a verb or preposition, or modifies the
object of a verb or preposition, the word order of an indirect question
differs from that of a direct question. In a direct question, the first
auxiliary precedes the subject, and the auxiliary <B>to do</B> must be used
for verbs in the Simple Present and Simple Past. In an indirect question,
the subject precedes the verb, and the auxiliary <B>to do</B> is not used.
Thus, in an indirect question, the word order used is the same as that used
for an affirmative statement.<BR>
<BR>
This difference in word order is illustrated in the following examples.<BR>
e.g. <U>Direct Question</U>: What <U>is</U> <B>he</B> <U>doing?</U><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: I will ask what <B>he</B> <U>is doing</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: What story <U>did</U> <B>they</B> <U>tell</U> you?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: I wonder what story <B>they</B> <U>told</U> you.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: Which <U>does</U> <B>she</B> <U>prefer</U>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: We asked which <B>she</B> <U>prefers</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: Whom <U>did</U> <B>he</B> <U>meet</U>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: Tell me whom <B>he</B> <U>met</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: To whom <U>has</U> <B>she</B> <U>sent</U> the invitations?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: They will ask to whom <B>she</B> <U>has sent</U> the invitations.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: For which friend <U>did</U> <B>they</B> <U>make</U> the arrangements?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: Do you know for which friend <B>they</B> <U>made</U> the arrangements?<BR>
<BR>
As illustrated in the preceding examples, when the interrogative word is
the object of a verb or preposition, or modifies the object of a verb or
preposition, the first auxiliary precedes the subject in a direct
question, but the subject precedes the verb in an indirect question.<BR>
<BR>

<B>iii. The verb To Be with a noun or pronoun complement</B><BR>
A noun, noun phrase
or pronoun which follows the verb <B>to be</B> is said to be the <B>complement</B>
of the verb. When <B>what</B> or <B>who</B> is followed by both the verb <B>to be</B>
and a noun or pronoun complement of the verb, the word order of an indirect
question usually differs from that of a direct question. As illustrated
in the following examples, in a direct question, the verb <B>to be</B> is
followed by its complement; whereas in an indirect question, the verb
<B>to be</B> is usually preceded by its complement.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 219-->
In each of the following examples, the verb <B>to be</B> is underlined, and its
noun or pronoun complement is printed in bold type.<BR>
e.g. <U>Direct Question</U>: What <U>is</U> <B>that</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect question</U>: Can you tell me what <B>that</B> <U>is</U>?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <U>Direct Question</U>: What <U>was</U> <B>that noise</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: I wonder what <B>that noise</B> <U>was</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: What time <U>is</U> <B>it</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: Ask him what time <B>it</B> <U>is</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: Who <U>is</U> <B>she</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: Do you know who <B>she</B> <U>is</U>?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct question</U>: Who <U>was</U> <B>that man</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: I will ask who <B>that man</B> <U>was</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: Whose shoes <U>are</U> <B>these</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: I wonder whose shoes <B>these</B> <U>are</U>.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, when <B>which</B> is followed by the verb <B>to be</B>, followed by a
<U>pronoun</U>, the pronoun complement generally <U>precedes</U> the verb in an indirect
question.<BR>
e.g. <U>Direct question</U>: Which <U>was</U> <B>it</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: I want to know which <B>it</B> <U>was</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: Which organization <U>is</U> <B>that</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: Please ask which organization <B>that</B> <U>is</U>.<BR>
<BR>
However, when <B>which</B> is followed by the verb <B>to be</B> followed by a
<U>noun</U> or noun phrase, the noun complement often <U>follows</U> the verb in an
indirect question.<BR>
e.g. <U>Direct Question</U>: Which <U>is</U> <B>the right road</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: Please tell me which <U>is</U> <B>the right road</B>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: Which insects <U>are</U> <B>predators</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: He wants to know which insects <U>are</U> <B>predators</B>.<BR>
<BR>It should be noted that in sentences with the verb <B>to be</B>, the word
order of indirect questions differs from that of direct questions only
when the verb is accompanied by a <U>noun</U> or <U>pronoun</U> complement.<BR>
<BR>
If the verb <B>to be</B> is accompanied by an <U>adjective</U>, the word order of
direct and indirect questions is the same. In each of the following
examples, the verb <B>to be</B> is underlined, and the accompanying adjective
is printed in bold type.<BR>
e.g. <U>Direct Question</U>: Who <U>is</U> <B>here</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: I will ask who <U>is</U> <B>here</B>.<BR>
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: Who <U>was</U> <B>successful</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: Tell me who <U>was</U> <B>successful</B>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Direct Question</U>: Which answer <U>is</U> <B>correct</B>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Indirect Question</U>: Please tell us which answer <U>is</U> <B>correct</B>.<BR>

<A NAME="5"></A>
<CENTER><B>5. Relative pronouns</B></CENTER><BR>

A </B>pronoun which is used to begin a subordinate clause can be referred
to as a <B>relative pronoun</B>, since it indicates the relationship of the
subordinate clause to the rest of the sentence.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, the underlined words in the following sentences are
relative pronouns.<BR>
e.g. The woman <U>who</U> is standing near the window is a doctor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The door, <U>which</U> was bright red, was very conspicuous.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have you found the book <U>that</U> was missing?<BR>
A subordinate clause which is introduced by a relative pronoun is often
referred to as a <B>relative clause</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5a"></A>
<B>a. Defining and non-defining relative clauses</B><BR>
Relative clauses can be divided into two types: those which merely give a
description of the object to which they refer, and those which define or
identify the object to which they refer.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5a1"></A>
<B>i. Non-defining relative clauses</B><BR>
When a relative clause merely
describes an object without having the function of defining or
identifying to which object the speaker or writer is referring, the
clause must be placed between commas. Such a clause can be called a
<B>non-defining</B> or <B>non-limiting</B> relative clause.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, in the example:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The door, which was bright red, was very conspicuous.<BR>
the commas indicate that the clause <B>which was bright red</B> is a
non-defining relative clause. In other words, this sentence implies
that it has already been made clear to which door the speaker or writer
is referring, and the clause <B>which was bright red</B> merely provides
additional, descriptive information about the door.<BR>
<BR>
Whereas in written English the presence of a non-defining relative
clause is indicated by the use of commas, in spoken English the
presence of such a clause is indicated by slightly emphasizing the word
immediately preceding the clause, and the last word of the clause. In
the following example, the emphasized words are underlined.<BR>
e.g. The <U>door</U>, which was bright <U>red</U>, was very conspicuous.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that when material written in English is read aloud,
the presence of a comma is usually indicated by a slight pause.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5a2"></A>
<B>ii. Defining relative clauses</B><BR>
When a relative clause has the function
of defining or identifying the object being referred to, the clause is
not placed between commas. Such a clause can be called a <B>defining</B> or
<B>limiting</B> relative clause.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, in the example:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The woman who is standing near the window is a doctor.<BR>
the absence of commas indicates that the clause <B>who is standing near the
window</B> is a defining relative clause. In other words, the clause has the
function of identifying to which woman the speaker or writer is referring.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 222-->
See <A HREF="gramex19.html#13">Exercise 13</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5b"></A>
<B>b. That</B><BR>
When used as a relative pronoun, <B>that</B> can refer to either persons
or things. The relative pronoun <B>that</B> is generally used only in
defining relative clauses. In the following examples, the relative
clauses are underlined.<BR>
e.g. The people <U>that were here yesterday</U> will return in a month.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The newspaper <U>that was on the steps</U> belongs to our neighbor.<BR>
In these examples, <B>that</B> has the antecedents <B>people</B> and <B>newspaper</B>,
and introduces the defining relative clauses <B>that were here yesterday</B>
and <B>that was on the steps</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In the preceding examples, <B>that</B> acts as the subject of the verbs
<B>were</B> and <B>was</B>. When it acts as the object of a verb or preposition,
the relative pronoun <B>that</B> can usually be omitted.<BR>
e.g. The books <U>that we bought</U> are heavy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The town <U>that this road leads to</U> is five miles away.<BR>
<BR>
In the first sentence, <B>that</B> acts as the object of the verb <B>bought</B>.
In the second sentence, <B>that</B> acts as the object of the preposition
<B>to</B>. The following examples show how the above sentences can be
rewritten without the use of <B>that</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The books <U>we bought</U> are heavy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The town <U>this road leads to</U> is five miles away.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5c"></A>
<B>c. Which</B><BR>
As was pointed out in an earlier section, when used as an adjective or
interrogative pronoun, <B>which</B> can refer to either persons or things.
However, it is important to note that when used as a relative pronoun,
<B>which</B> can refer only to things.<BR>
<BR>
The relative pronoun <B>which</B> can be used in either defining or
non-defining relative clauses.<BR>
e.g. The suitcase <U>which we purchased last week</U> is very strong.
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sack, <U>which was full of rocks</U>, was too heavy to lift.<BR>
In the first example, <B>which</B> has the antecedent <B>suitcase</B>, and introduces
the defining relative clause <B>which we purchased last week</B>. In the second
example, <B>which</B> has the antecedent <B>sack</B>, and introduces the non-defining
relative clause <B>which was full of rocks</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5d"></A>
<B>d. Who, Whom and Whose</B><BR>
The use of <B>who</B>, <B>whom</B> and <B>whose</B> as relative pronouns is similar to
their use as interrogative pronouns. <B>Who</B> is used as the subject of a
verb, <B>whom</B> is used as the object of a verb or the object of a preposition,
and <B>whose</B> is used as an adjective indicating possession. The relative
pronouns <B>who</B>, <B>whom</B> and <B>whose</B> can generally refer only to persons, and can be
used either in defining or non-defining relative clauses.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 223-->
In the following examples, <B>who</B> introduces the defining relative clause
<B>who runs the fastest</B> and the non-defining relative clause <B>who is studying German</B>.<BR>
e.g. The child <U>who runs the fastest</U> will receive a prize.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My sister, <U>who is studying German</U>, wants to travel to Switzerland.<BR>
In these examples, <B>who</B> has the antecedents <B>child</B> and <B>sister</B>, and
acts as the subject of the verbs <B>runs</B> and <B>is studying</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In the following examples, <B>whom</B> introduces the defining relative
clause <B>whom we visited</B> and the non-defining relative clause <B>whom we
will meet tomorrow</B>.<BR>
e.g. The boy <U>whom we visited</U> is her nephew.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Henry, <U>whom we will meet tomorrow</U>, will be our guide.<BR>
In these examples, <B>whom</B> has the antecedents <B>boy</B> and <B>Mr. Henry</B>, and
acts as the object of the verbs <B>visited</B> and <B>will meet</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In the following examples, <B>to whom</B> introduces the defining relative
clause <B>to whom you sold your skis</B> and the non-defining relative clause
<B>to whom we send a birthday card every year</B>.<BR>
e.g. The girl <U>to whom you sold your skis</U> lives in the next block.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His uncle, <U>to whom we send a birthday card every year</U>, is ninety-one
years old.<BR>
In these examples, <B>whom</B> has the antecedents <B>girl</B> and <B>uncle</B>, and is
the object of the preposition <B>to</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In the following examples, <B>whose</B> introduces the defining relative
clause <B>whose house was sold</B> and the non-defining relative clause
<B>whose family lives in Europe</B>.<BR>
e.g. The woman <U>whose house was sold</U> will retire to the country.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My cousin, <U>whose family lives in Europe</U>, will visit us for a few
weeks.<BR>
In these examples, <B>whose</B> has the antecedents <B>woman</B> and <B>cousin</B>, and
modifies the nouns <B>house</B> and <B>family</B>. In the case of <B>whose</B>, it
should be noted that it is the antecedent which must be a person; the
noun being modified may be a person or a thing.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5dwh"></A>
<BR>
In informal English, <B>whose</B> at the beginning of a clause is occasionally
used to refer not only to persons, but also to things, in order to make a
simpler sentence. For example, the following sentence is considered
grammatically correct in formal English.<BR>
e.g. The tree, <U>the branches of which overhung the street</U>, was covered
with blossoms.<BR>
In informal English, the phrase <B>the branches of which</B> might be
replaced by <B>whose branches</B>, as illustrated in the following example.<BR>
e.g. The tree, <U>whose branches overhung the street</U>, was covered with
blossoms.<BR>
However, this use of <B>whose</B> is considered to be grammatically incorrect
in formal English.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5e"></A>
<B>e. Comparison of the use of That, Which and Who</B><BR>
The use of the relative pronouns <B>that</B>, <B>which</B> and <B>who</B> is summarized
in the following table.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 224-->
<TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Relative Pronoun</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Type of Clause</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Type of Antecedent</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; that</TD><TD>&nbsp; defining clause only</TD><TD>&nbsp; persons or things</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; which</TD><TD>&nbsp; defining or non-defining</TD><TD>&nbsp; things only</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; who/whom/whose</TD><TD>&nbsp; defining or non-defining</TD><TD>&nbsp; persons only</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
From the preceding table it can be inferred that in the case of defining
relative clauses, <B>that</B> may be used to replace <B>who</B>, <B>whom</B> or <B>which</B>.
For instance, the following sentences:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The boy <U>whom</U> we saw is her brother.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hat <U>which</U> you are wearing is rather large.<BR>
could be rewritten:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The boy <U>that</U> we saw is her brother.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hat <U>that</U> you are wearing is rather large.<BR>
<BR>
Like the relative pronoun <B>that</B>, <B>whom</B> and <B>which</B> can generally be
omitted when they act as the object of the verb in a relative clause.
Thus, the preceding sentences could also be rewritten:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The boy we saw is her brother.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hat you are wearing is rather large.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that when <B>whom</B> or <B>which</B> is the object of a
preposition, the preposition immediately precedes the relative pronoun.<BR>
e.g. The boy <U>to</U> <U>whom</U> we sent the message was excited.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The room <U>to</U> <U>which</U> you will be conducted has beautiful furniture.<BR>
In these examples, <B>whom</B> and <B>which</B> are immediately preceded by the
preposition <B>to</B>.<BR>
<BR>
However, when the relative pronoun <B>that</B> is the object of a preposition,
the preposition is normally placed at the end of the relative clause. For
instance, if <B>that</B> is used, the second example must be rewritten as follows:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The room <U>that</U> you will be conducted <U>to</U> has beautiful furniture.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5f"></A>
<B>f. Other relative pronouns</B><BR>
Relative pronouns such as <B>what</B>, <B>whatever</B> and <B>whoever</B> are normally
used without antecedents. When used as a relative pronoun, <B>what</B> has
the meaning <B>the thing or things that</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>What</U> you say is true.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>What</U> he did was wrong.<BR>
In these examples, the relative pronoun <B>what</B> introduces the clauses
<B>what you say</B> and <B>what he did</B>. Such clauses are often referred to
as <B>noun clauses</B>, since they can serve some of the functions of a noun.
For instance, in the preceding sentences, the clause <B>what you say</B> acts
as the subject of the verb <B>is</B>, and the clause <B>what he did</B> acts as
the subject of the verb <B>was</B>.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Whatever</B> has the meaning <B>no matter what</B>, or <B>anything which</B>.
<B>Whoever</B> has the meaning <B>no matter who</B>, or <B>anyone who</B>.<BR>
e.g. You can tell me <U>whatever</U> you like.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let in <U>whoever</U> comes to the door.<BR>
In these examples, the noun clauses <B>whatever you like</B> and <B>whoever
comes to the door</B> act as the objects of the verbs in the main clauses.
