<A NAME="1"></A>
<CENTER><B>1. The absence of a determiner before plural countable nouns</B></CENTER><BR>

The absence of a determiner before plural countable nouns generally
has the same significance as the presence of <B>a</B> or <B>an</B> before singular
countable nouns.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1a"></A>
<B>a. Making a general statement</B><BR>
When used in general statements, plural countable nouns are usually not
preceded by determiners. The plural countable nouns in the following
general statements are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <U>Musicians</U> must practise a great deal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Newspapers</U> can contain valuable information.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Larches</U> are <U>conifers</U>.<BR>
<BR>
A general idea can often be expressed either by means of a singular
countable noun preceded by <B>a</B> or <B>an</B>, or by means of a plural
countable noun not preceded by a determiner. For instance, in each of
the following pairs of sentences, both sentences in the pair have the
same meaning.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Musicians must practise a great deal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A musician must practise a great deal.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Newspapers can contain valuable information.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A newspaper can contain valuable information.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Larches are conifers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A larch is a conifer.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex15.html#1">Exercises 1</A>, <A HREF="gramex15.html#2">2</A>, <A HREF="gramex15.html#3">3</A> and <A HREF="gramex15.html#4">4</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1b"></A>
<B>b. Referring to something not mentioned before</B><BR>
Plural countable nouns are generally not preceded by a determiner when
referring to something not mentioned before.<BR>
e.g. <U>Branches</U> blocked our path.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Clouds</U> were gathering overhead.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly we saw <U>buildings</U> in front of us.<BR>
In these examples, the plural nouns <B>branches</B>, <B>clouds</B> and <B>buildings</B>
are not preceded by determiners. It is assumed that the branches,
clouds and buildings have not been referred to previously.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1c"></A>
<B>c. Naming a profession</B><BR>
When a sentence such as the following is used to name a profession
practised by two or more people, the name of the profession is in the
plural and is not preceded by a determiner.<BR>
e.g. They are <U>doctors</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My friends are <U>electricians</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We were <U>chefs</U>.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<!--page 165-->
<A NAME="2"></A>
<CENTER><B>2. The use of The before plural countable nouns</B></CENTER><BR>

<A NAME="2a"></A>
<B>a. Referring to something mentioned before</B><BR>
In general, <B>the</B> has the same meaning when used with plural countable
nouns as when used with singular countable nouns. For instance, <B>the</B>
is used with plural countable nouns when referring to something which
has been mentioned before.<BR>
e.g. Fallen <U>leaves</U> covered the ground. <U>The leaves</U> rustled as we walked.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the orchard were <U>apples</U> and pears. <U>The apples</U> were nearly ripe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The doors opened, and <U>students</U> and teachers began leaving the building. <U>The students</U> were talking and laughing.<BR>
<BR>In these examples, the first time the words <B>leaves</B>, <B>apples</B> and
<B>students</B> appear, they are not preceded by determiners, because the
things referred to have not been mentioned previously. The second time
the words <B>leaves</B>, <B>apples</B> and <B>students</B> appear, they are preceded by
<B>the</B>, since the things referred to have already been mentioned.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex15.html#5">Exercise 5</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2b"></A>
<B>b. Referring to something when it is considered obvious what is meant</B><BR>
<B>The</B> is used with plural countable nouns when the speaker or writer
considers it obvious which particular persons or things are meant.<BR>
e.g. <U>The stars</U> are shining brightly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>The roses</U> are blooming.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have put <U>the children</U> to bed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was sitting on <U>the front steps</U>.<BR>
<BR>
These sentences give examples of the use of <B>the</B> to refer to things
which are particularly important to the speaker or writer. The
expression <B>the stars</B> usually refers to the stars which can be seen
from the part of the earth where one lives. The expression <B>the roses</B>
might refer to roses in one's own garden, or to roses in which one feels
a particular interest. <B>The children</B> might refer to one's own children
or to children for whom one is responsible. <B>The front steps</B> might
refer to the front steps of one's own house.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2c"></A>
<B>c. Names of nationalities</B><BR>
<B>The</B> is sometimes used with the name of a nationality in order to make
a general statement about the people of that nationality. A plural verb
must be used in such a statement.<BR>
<BR>
When the name of a nationality ends in the sound of <B>ch</B>, <B>s</B>, <B>sh</B> or <B>z</B>,
the name of the nationality must usually be preceded by <B>the</B>.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<TR><TD>&nbsp; Irish</TD><TD>&nbsp; The Irish are known as poets and songwriters.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
<BR>

<!--page 166-->
When the name of a nationality does not end in the sound of <B>ch</B>, <B>s</B>,
<B>sh</B> or <B>z</B>, the letter <B>s</B> must be added to the end of the name when it
is used in a general statement. Names of nationalities to which <B>s</B> has
been added are often used without being preceded by <B>the</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2d"></A>
<B>d. Adjectives referring to classes of people</B><BR>
Adjectives such as <B>rich</B> and <B>poor</B> can be used with <B>the</B> in order to
refer to a group of people as a class. A plural verb must be used.<BR>
e.g. <U>The blind</U> attend special schools.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>The poor</U> do not own their own homes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>The rich</U> often married for money.<BR>
In the above examples, <B>the blind</B> has the meaning of <B>blind people</B>,
<B>the poor</B> has the meaning of <B>poor people</B>, and <B>the rich</B> has the
meaning of <B>rich people</B>.<BR>

<A NAME="3"></A>
<CENTER><B>3. The use of The with proper nouns</B></CENTER><BR>

<A NAME="3a"></A>
<B>a. Names of people</B><BR>
In English, names of people in the singular are not usually preceded by
a determiner.<BR>
e.g. <U>Washington</U> was the first president of the United States.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Jack</U> and <U>Eleanor</U> saw the movie.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 167-->
Determiners are also usually not used when a title precedes a person's name.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Doctor Defoe</U> has a good reputation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Mr. Carpenter</U> is a friend of ours.<BR>
In these examples, the titles <B>Doctor</B> and <B>Mr.</B> are not preceded by
determiners.<BR>
<BR>
However, names of people in the plural are usually preceded by <B>the</B>.
<BR>
e.g. <U>The Smiths</U> live in that house.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have known <U>the Harrisons</U> for years.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3b"></A>
<B>b. Names of places</B><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <U><B>Type of Place Name</B></U><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; canal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; desert<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ocean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; river<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sea<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; plural place names<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; place names containing the word <B>of</B><BR>
<BR>
The following are examples of names of canals, deserts, oceans, rivers,
and seas:<BR>
e.g. the Panama Canal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Mojave Desert<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Atlantic Ocean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the St. Lawrence River<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Beaufort Sea<BR>
<BR>
The following are examples of plural place names:<BR>
e.g. the United States<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the British Isles<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Great Lakes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Rocky Mountains<BR>
<BR>
The following are examples of place names containing the word <B>of</B>:<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Cape of Good Hope<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Bay of Biscay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Isle of Wight<BR>

<A NAME="4"></A>
<CENTER><B>4. Nouns used only in the plural</B></CENTER><BR>

Some English nouns are usually used only in the plural. Such nouns take
a plural verb, and generally have a plural form. For instance, the
following nouns, which all refer to objects with two parts, are usually
used only in the plural:<BR>
e.g. jeans<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pajamas<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pliers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scissors<BR>
<BR>
If it is desired to refer to such objects individually, the expression
<B>pair of</B> is often used.<BR>
e.g. a pair of jeans<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a pair of pajamas<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a pair of pliers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a pair of scissors<BR>
<BR>
When the expression <B>pair of</B> is used as the subject of the verb, the
verb must agree with the word <B>pair</B>.
<BR>
e.g. Jeans <U>are</U> fashionable.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pair of jeans <U>is</U> expensive.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pliers <U>are</U> very useful.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pair of pliers <U>is</U> often useful.<BR>
<BR>In the above examples, the nouns <B>jeans</B> and <B>pliers</B> take the plural
verb <B>are</B>, and the noun <B>pair</B> takes the singular verb <B>is</B>.<BR>
<BR>
