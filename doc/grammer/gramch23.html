<CENTER><B>1. Comparative and superlative forms of adjectives which do not use endings</B></CENTER><BR>

Adjectives which follow the model of the French language do not use the
endings <B>er</B> and <B>est</B>. Instead, the adjectives are preceded by the
adverbs <B>more</B> and <B>most</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1a"></A>
<B>a. Comparative forms: The use of More</B><BR>
The comparative form of an adjective which does not take endings is formed
by placing the word <B>more</B> before the positive form of the adjective.<BR>
e.g. She is <U>more intelligent</U> than her sister.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is <U>more determined</U> than his brother.<BR>
In these examples, the comparative forms of the adjectives <B>intelligent</B>
and <B>determined</B> have been formed by placing the word <B>more</B> before the
positive forms of the adjectives.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex23.html#1">Exercise 1</A>.<BR>
<BR>
With the exception of two-syllable adjectives ending in <B>y</B>, most
adjectives of more than one syllable form the comparative with the
adverb <B>more</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, a few one-syllable adjectives, including one-syllable past
participles used as adjectives, form the comparative with the adverb <B>more</B>.<BR>
e.g. This nail is <U>more bent</U> than that one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is <U>more skilled</U> than his brother.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She is <U>more spoiled</U> than her cousin.<BR>
<A NAME="1asu"></A>
<BR>
The following table summarizes the formation of the comparative forms of
English adjectives.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1a1"></A>
<B>i. The comparative form followed by Than</B><BR>
Adjectives which form the comparative with the adverb <B>more</B> are used in the same constructions
as adjectives which form the comparative with the ending <B>er</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 302-->
The following examples illustrate the use of the two types of comparative
form followed by <B>than</B>.<BR>
e.g. Tom is <U>wiser</U> <B>than</B> Ned.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tom is <U>more intelligent</U> <B>than</B> Ned.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Parchment is <U>stronger</U> <B>than</B> paper.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Parchment is <U>more durable</U> <B>than</B> paper.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex23.html#2">Exercise 2</A>.<BR>
<BR>
The following examples illustrate the use of the two types of comparative
form followed by a noun, followed by <B>than</B>.<BR>
e.g. Kirby is a <U>finer</U> musician <B>than</B> Tim.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kirby is a <U>more confident</U> musician <B>than</B> Tim.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rubber is a <U>tougher</U> material <B>than</B> leather.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rubber is a <U>more waterproof</U> material <B>than</B> leather.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She has <U>better</U> tools <B>than</B> we do.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She has <U>more expensive</U> tools <B>than</B> we do.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex23.html#3">Exercise 3</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1a2"></A>
<B>ii. Progressive comparisons</B><BR>
Like adjectives which take endings,
adjectives which form the comparative with the adverb <B>more</B> can be
used in progressive comparisons.<BR>
<BR>
In the case of an adjective which takes endings, the comparative form of
the adjective is repeated in a progressive comparison. However, in the
case of an adjective which forms the comparative with <B>more</B>, only the
word <B>more</B> is repeated. This construction is summarized below, followed by examples.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; noun, pronoun or</TD><TD>&nbsp; linking verb,</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp;  positive</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; other expression &nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; such as &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>more</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>and</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>more</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; form of</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; representing thing</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>to grow</B> or</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; adjective</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; being described</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>to become</B></TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; The park</TD><TD>&nbsp; is becoming</TD><TD>&nbsp; more</TD><TD>&nbsp; and</TD><TD>&nbsp; more</TD><TD>&nbsp; beautiful.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; The horses</TD><TD>&nbsp; grew</TD><TD>&nbsp; more</TD><TD>&nbsp; and</TD><TD>&nbsp; more</TD><TD>&nbsp; restless.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
The following examples illustrate the use of the two types of comparative
form in progressive comparisons.<BR>
e.g. Tom became <U>angrier and angrier</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tom became <U>more and more anxious</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The stars grew <U>brighter and brighter</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The stars grew <U>more and more brilliant</U>.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex23.html#4">Exercise 4</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1b"></A>
<B>b. The use of Less</B><BR>
Adjectives which form the comparative with the adverb <B>more</B> may also be
used in a similar way with the adverb <B>less</B>. <B>Less</B> and <B>more</B> have
opposite meanings.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 303-->
<A NAME="1b1"></A>
<B>i. The construction Less ... Than</B><BR>
The following examples illustrate
the use of adjectives preceded by <B>less</B> and followed by <B>than</B>.<BR>
e.g. Arnold is <U>less confident</U> <B>than</B> Charles is.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The red bicycle is <U>less expensive</U> <B>than</B> the blue one.<BR>
The first example indicates that Arnold possesses a smaller degree of
confidence than Charles does. The second example indicates that the red
bicycle has a lower cost than the blue one.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex23.html#5">Exercise 5</A>.<BR>
<BR>
The following examples illustrate the use of adjectives preceded by
<B>less</B>, and followed by a noun, followed by <B>than</B>.<BR>
e.g. He is a <U>less well-known</U> performer <B>than</B> his brother is.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They found themselves in a <U>less fortunate</U> situation <B>than</B> they had
expected.<BR>
In these examples, the adjectives <B>well-known</B> and <B>fortunate</B> are
followed by the nouns <B>performer</B> and <B>situation</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1b2"></A>
<B>ii. The construction Not As ... As</B><BR>
In informal English, the following
construction is often used:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; positive</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>not as</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; form of &nbsp; &nbsp; +</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>as</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; adjective</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; e.g. He is</TD><TD>&nbsp; not as</TD><TD>&nbsp; reliable</TD><TD>&nbsp; as</TD><TD>&nbsp; his brother.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
For adjectives which form the comparative with <B>more</B>, either the
construction <B>less ... than</B> or the construction <B>not as ... as</B> may be
used. The construction <B>not as ... as</B> is somewhat less formal than the
construction <B>less ... than</B>.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, the two sentences in each of the following pairs have the same
meaning.<BR>
e.g. <U>Formal</U>: The red bicycle is <U>less expensive</U> <B>than</B> the blue one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Informal</U>: The red bicycle is <B>not as</B> <U>expensive</U> <B>as</B> the blue one.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Formal</U>: Arnold is <U>less confident</U> <B>than</B> Charles is.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Informal</U>: Arnold is <B>not as</B> <U>confident</U> <B>as</B> Charles is.<BR>
<BR>
For adjectives which form the comparative with the ending <B>er</B>, either
the construction <B>not as ... as</B>, or the comparative form of an adjective
of opposite meaning may be used.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, the two sentences in each of the following pairs have similar
meanings.<BR>
e.g. This chair is <B>not as</B> <U>soft</U> <B>as</B> that one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This chair is <U>harder</U> <B>than</B> that one.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is <B>not as</B> <U>old</U> <B>as</B> his sister.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is <U>younger</U> <B>than</B> his sister.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 304-->
<A NAME="1b3"></A>
<B>iii. The construction Less and Less</B><BR>
Both adjectives which take endings
and adjectives which form the comparative with the adverb <B>more</B> can be
used with the idiom <B>less and less</B>. This construction is summarized below, followed by examples.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; noun, pronoun or</TD><TD>&nbsp; linking verb,</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp;  positive</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; other expression&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; such as &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>less</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>and</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>less</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; form of</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; representing thing</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>to grow</B> or</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp;  adjective</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; being described</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>to become</B></TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; The water</TD><TD>&nbsp; is becoming</TD><TD>&nbsp; less</TD><TD>&nbsp; and</TD><TD>&nbsp; less</TD><TD>&nbsp; rough.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; The situation</TD><TD>&nbsp; grew</TD><TD>&nbsp; less</TD><TD>&nbsp; and</TD><TD>&nbsp; less</TD><TD>&nbsp; predictable.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
The meaning of these two examples can also be expressed as follows:<BR>
e.g. The water is becoming <U>decreasingly rough</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The situation grew <U>decreasingly predictable</U>.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex23.html#6">Exercise 6</A>.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that an adjective in a progressive comparison does
not express exactly the same meaning as an adjective of opposite meaning
used with the idiom <B>less and less</B>.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, the following two sentences have somewhat different meanings.<BR>
e.g. The water is becoming <U>less and less rough</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The water is becoming <U>calmer and calmer</U>.<BR>
<BR>
The adjectives <B>rough</B> and <B>calm</B> have opposite meanings. The first
example implies that the water is still quite rough, but that it is
becoming decreasingly rough. The second example implies that the water
is already quite calm, but that it is becoming increasingly calm.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="1c"></A>
<B>c. Superlative Forms</B><BR>
As illustrated in the following table, the superlative form of adjectives
which do not use endings is formed by placing the word <B>most</B> before the
positive form of the adjective.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Positive Form</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Comparative Form</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Superlative Form</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; beautiful</TD><TD>&nbsp; more beautiful</TD><TD>&nbsp; <U>most</U> beautiful</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; dangerous</TD><TD>&nbsp; more dangerous</TD><TD>&nbsp; <U>most</U> dangerous</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; intelligent</TD><TD>&nbsp; more intelligent</TD><TD>&nbsp; <U>most</U>  intelligent</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; interesting</TD><TD>&nbsp; more interesting</TD><TD>&nbsp; <U>most</U> interesting</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
For example:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She is the <U>most intelligent</U> child in the family.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the <U>most interesting</U> book I have ever read.<BR>
<BR>
Adjectives which form the superlative with the adverb <B>most</B> are used in
the same constructions as adjectives which form the superlative with the
ending <B>est</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 305-->
The following examples illustrate the use of the two types of superlative
form preceded by the word <B>the</B> and followed by a noun.<BR>
e.g. Quebec is one of <B>the</B> <U>oldest</U> cities in Canada.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quebec is one of <B>the</B> <U>most attractive</U> cities in Canada.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is <B>the</B> <U>hardest</U> question on the test.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is <B>the</B> <U>most difficult</U> question on the test.<BR>
<BR>
The following examples illustrate the use of the two types of superlative
form preceded by a possessive adjective and followed by a noun.<BR>
e.g. This is <B>his</B> <U>newest</U> invention.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is <B>his</B> <U>most recent</U> invention.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She is <B>my</B> <U>closest</U> friend.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She is <B>my</B> <U>most trusted</U> friend.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex23.html#7">Exercise 7</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Adjectives which form the superlative with the adverb <B>most</B> may also be
used in a similar way with the adverb <B>least</B>. <B>Least</B> and <B>most</B> have
opposite meanings.<BR>
e.g. This is <B>the</B> <U>least interesting</U> book I have ever read.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is <B>the</B> <U>least difficult</U> question on the test.<P>

<CENTER><B>2. The adjectives Many, Much, Few and Little used to compare quantities</B></CENTER><BR>

<A NAME="2a"></A>
<B>a. The use of Many, Much, Few and Little with countable and
uncountable nouns</B><BR>
The adjectives <B>many</B> and <B>much</B> have the same meaning, except that
<B>many</B> is used with plural countable nouns, and <B>much</B> is used with
uncountable nouns.<BR>
e.g. He has written <U>many</U> books.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How <U>much</U> snow has fallen?<BR>
In these examples, <B>books</B> is a plural countable noun modified by
<B>many</B>, and <B>snow</B> is an uncountable noun modified by <B>much</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="2mo"></A>
<BR>
As pointed out in the previous chapter, the two adjectives <B>many</B> and
<B>much</B> have the same comparative form, <B>more</B>, and the same superlative
form, <B>most</B>. <B>More</B> and <B>most</B> can be used to modify both countable
and uncountable nouns.<BR>
<A NAME="2fl"></A>
<BR>
Similarly, the adjectives <B>few</B> and <B>little</B> have the same meaning, except that
<B>few</B> is used with plural countable nouns, and <B>little</B> is used with
uncountable nouns.<BR>
e.g. I made <U>few</U> mistakes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They have <U>little</U> hope of success.<BR>
In these examples, <B>mistakes</B> is a plural countable noun modified by
<B>few</B>, and <B>hope</B> is an uncountable noun modified by <B>little</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="2st"></A>
<BR>

<!--page 306-->
The comparative and superlative forms of <B>few</B> and <B>little</B> follow the
same rules as the positive forms. Thus, the adjectives <B>fewer</B> and
<B>fewest</B> are used to modify plural countable nouns, and the adjectives
<B>less</B> and <B>least</B> are used to modify uncountable nouns.<BR>
e.g. This recipe requires <U>fewer</U> eggs <B>than</B> that recipe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This street has <U>less</U> traffic <B>than</B> that street.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This recipe requires <B>the</B> <U>fewest</U> eggs.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This street has <B>the</B> <U>least</U> traffic.<BR>
<BR>
In these examples <B>eggs</B> is a plural countable noun modified by <B>fewer</B>
and <B>fewest</B>, and <B>traffic</B> is an uncountable noun modified by <B>less</B>
and <B>least</B>.<BR>
<A NAME="2asu"></A>
<BR>
The use of these adjectives with countable and uncountable nouns is
summarized below. The adjectives in the left-hand column are used to compare quantities of things which can be counted, while those in the right-hand column are used to compare amounts of things which are considered as substances.<BR>

<A NAME="2b"></A>
<B>b. Synonyms for Many and Much</B><BR>
In questions and negative statements, the adjectives <B>many</B> and <B>much</B>
are commonly used in both formal and informal English.<BR>
e.g. <U>Question</U>: How <U>many</U> museums have you visited?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Negative Statement</U>: He does not have <U>much</U> confidence.<BR>
<BR>
In affirmative statements, the adjectives <B>many</B> and <B>much</B> are commonly
used in combination with words such as <B>as</B>, <B>so</B> and <B>too</B>.<BR>
e.g. I have read twice <U>as many</U> books as you have.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He has <U>so much</U> money he can buy whatever he likes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are <U>too many</U> possibilities to consider.<BR>
<BR>
However, in affirmative statements not containing words such as <B>as</B>, <B>so</B>
and <B>too</B>, the adjective <B>much</B> is rarely used in either formal or informal
English, and the adjective <B>many</B> is rarely used in informal English.
Instead, synonyms are used.<BR>
<A NAME="2bgr"></A>
<BR>
The phrases <B>a great deal of</B>, <B>a lot of</B>, and <B>lots of</B> are used as
synonyms for <B>much</B>. The phrase <B>a great deal of</B> may be used in formal
English, and the phrases <B>a lot of</B> and <B>lots of</B> may be used in informal
English. The phrase <B>lots of</B> is more informal than the phrase <B>a lot of</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>Formal</U>: He has <U>a great deal of</U> confidence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Informal</U>: He has <U>a lot of</U> confidence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>More Informal</U>: He has <U>lots of</U> confidence.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 307-->
In informal English, the phrases <B>a lot of</B> and <B>lots of</B> are used as
synonyms for <B>many</B>. The phrase <B>lots of</B> is more informal than the
phrase <B>a lot of</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>Formal</U>: There are <U>many</U> possibilities.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Informal</U>: There are <U>a lot of</U> possibilities.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>More Informal</U>: There are <U>lots of</U> possibilities.<BR>

The positive forms <B>many</B>, <B>much</B>, <B>few</B> and <B>little</B> can also be
combined with expressions referring to a quantity of something. This
type of construction is summarized below, followed by examples.<BR>
<BR>

</TABLE>
<BR>
It should be noted that when a noun names a unit of currency or a unit
of measurement, the amount referred to is usually considered as a whole.
When this is the case, the noun acts as an uncountable noun, in that it
may be modified by the adjectives <B>much</B>, <B>little</B> and <B>less</B>.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, in the examples:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yesterday he drank as <U>much</U> as three <B>liters</B> of milk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The magazines cost as <U>little</U> as fifteen <B>cents</B>.<BR>

<!--page 308-->
the noun <B>liters</B> names a unit of measurement, and the noun <B>cents</B> names
a unit of currency. Since the amounts referred to are each considered as
a whole, the adjectives <B>much</B> and <B>little</B> are used.<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, in the following examples, the noun <B>dollars</B> names a unit of
currency, and the nouns <B>ounces</B> and <B>degrees</B> name units of measurement.<BR>
e.g. We saved as <U>much</U> as fifteen <B>dollars</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The kittens weighed as <U>little</U> as three <B>ounces</B> each.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The temperature this morning was <U>less</U> than five <B>degrees</B>.<BR>
In these examples, the nouns printed in bold type refer to amounts considered as a
whole, and the adjectives <B>much</B>, <B>little</B> and <B>less</B> are used.<BR>

<B>d. Comparative forms used in comparisons</B><BR>
The comparative forms <B>more</B>, <B>fewer</B> and <B>less</B> are often employed in
comparisons using the following construction:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; comparative&nbsp; &nbsp;+</TD><TD>&nbsp; noun&nbsp; &nbsp; +</TD><TD>&nbsp; <B>than</B></TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; form</TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; e.g. I bought</TD><TD>&nbsp; more</TD><TD>&nbsp; apples</TD><TD>&nbsp; than</TD><TD>&nbsp; I needed.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We eat</TD><TD>&nbsp; more</TD><TD>&nbsp; rice</TD><TD>&nbsp; than</TD><TD>&nbsp; they do.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The class has</TD><TD>&nbsp; fewer</TD><TD>&nbsp; boys</TD><TD>&nbsp; than</TD><TD>&nbsp; girls.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They ate</TD><TD>&nbsp; less</TD><TD>&nbsp; cake</TD><TD>&nbsp; than</TD><TD>&nbsp; we did.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
This type of construction can also be combined with phrases or clauses.
When two phrases or clauses are used to distinguish the things being
compared, the word <B>than</B> may be placed before the second phrase or
clause.<BR>
e.g. There is more wood <U>in the park</U> <B>than</B> <U>on the island</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have more fun <U>when we go out</U> <B>than</B> <U>when we stay at home</U>.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example two locations are distinguished by the phrases <B>in
the park</B> and <B>on the island</B>, and the second phrase, <B>on the island</B>,
is preceded by the word <B>than</B>. In the second example two situations
are distinguished by the clauses <B>when we go out</B> and <B>when we stay at
home</B>, and the second clause, <B>when we stay at home</B>, is preceded by the
word <B>than</B>.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex23.html#10">Exercise 10</A>.<BR>
<BR>
The comparative forms <B>more</B>, <B>fewer</B> and <B>less</B> can also be used
in comparisons referring to a quantity of something. The type of
construction used is summarized below, followed by examples.<BR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His timetable</TD><TD>&nbsp; is</TD><TD>&nbsp; the same as</TD><TD>&nbsp; yours.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
See <A HREF="gramex23.html#12">Exercise 12</A>.<BR>
<BR>
The adjective <B>similar</B> followed by the preposition <B>to</B> can be used in
comparing things which have characteristics in common.<BR>
e.g. The landscape of Maine is <U>similar to</U> that of Scandinavia.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His background is <U>similar to</U> yours.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 310-->
The adjective <B>different</B> followed by the preposition <B>from</B> can be used
in comparing things which have differing characteristics.<BR>
e.g. His ideas are <U>different from</U> mine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fish that live in the ocean are <U>different from</U> fish that live in
rivers and lakes.<BR>
<BR>
The verb <B>differ</B> followed by the preposition <B>from</B> can also be used in
comparing things which have differing characteristics.<BR>
e.g. His ideas <U>differ from</U> mine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fish that live in the ocean <U>differ from</U> fish that live in
rivers and lakes.<BR>
<BR>
The phrase <B>the same</B> followed by <B>as</B> can be used in comparing things
which are identical in some respect.<BR>
e.g. Your shoes look <U>the same as</U> mine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The temperature of the water is <U>the same as</U> the temperature of the air.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that the phrase <B>the same</B> can also be followed by a
noun or other expression, as indicated below:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

</TABLE><BR>
If desired, adverbs may be used before the expressions <B>similar to</B>,
<B>different from</B> and <B>the same</B>, in order to modify these types of
comparisons. The adverbs in the following examples are underlined.<BR>
e.g. Her bicycle looks <U>quite</U> similar to mine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The result was <U>somewhat</U> different from what I had expected.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His timetable is <U>almost</U> the same as yours.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My coat is <U>nearly</U> the same color as hers.<BR>

<CENTER><B>4. Making logical comparisons</B></CENTER><BR>

If complex sentences containing phrases or clauses are used to make
comparisons, care must be taken, particularly in formal English, to
ensure that the comparisons are logical and that the appropriate objects
are in fact being compared.<BR>
<BR>
For example, the following sentence is logically incorrect, because it
compares <B>life in the country</B> to <B>the city</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>Life in the country</U> is different from <U>the city</U>.<BR>
<BR>
In order to be logically correct, the sentence must be changed so that
similar types of things are being compared.<BR>
e.g. <U>Life in the country</U> is different from <U>life in the city</U>.<BR>
This sentence is logically correct, since it compares <B>life in the country</B>
to <B>life in the city</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, the following sentence is logically incorrect, because it
compares <B>the vowel sounds of English</B> to <B>Spanish</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>The vowel sounds of English</U> are more numerous than <U>Spanish</U>.<BR>
<BR>
In order to be logically correct, the sentence must be changed so that
similar types of things are being compared. Thus, the sentence may be
corrected as follows:<BR>
e.g. <U>The vowel sounds of English</U> are more numerous than <U>the vowel sounds
of Spanish</U>.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex23.html#14">Exercise 14</A>.<BR>
<BR>
In such sentences, the noun or phrase which is repeated in the second
part of the comparison may be replaced by <B>that</B> or <B>those</B>. <B>That</B> is
used if the noun being replaced is singular, and <B>those</B> is used if the
noun being replaced is plural.<BR>
e.g. Life in the country is different from <U>that</U> in the city.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The vowel sounds of English are more numerous than <U>those</U> of Spanish.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, <B>that</B> is used to replace the singular noun
<B>life</B>. In the second example, <B>those</B> is used to replace the phrase
<B>the vowel sounds</B>. The form <B>those</B> must be used, since the noun
<B>sounds</B> is plural.<BR>
<BR>
