<CENTER><B>1. Uses of the subjunctive</B></CENTER><BR>
In modern English, the Simple Present Subjunctive is most commonly used
in formal commands and requests. In the following examples, the verbs in
the Simple Present Subjunctive are underlined.
<BR>
e.g. They demand that he <U>submit</U> a report.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We request that you <U>be</U> here tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>
The Simple Present Subjunctive is also still used in a few traditional expressions.<BR>
e.g. Long <U>live</U> the King!
<BR>
<BR>
The past tenses of the Subjunctive, and the auxiliary <B>would</B>, are used
in expressing wishes.<BR>
e.g. I wish you <U>were</U> here.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wish I <U>had known</U> that.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wish the rain <U>would stop</U>.<BR>
<BR>
The past tenses of the Subjunctive, and the auxiliary <B>would</B>, can also
be used in order to indicate that conditions being expressed are false or improbable.<BR>
e.g. If I <U>were</U> rich, I <U>would travel</U> around the world.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he <U>had been</U> here, he <U>would have been</U> glad to see you.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the use of the Simple Past Subjunctive <B>were</B>
and the Simple conjugation with <B>would</B> indicates that the condition
expressed in the clause <B>If I were rich</B> is false or improbable. In the second example, the use of the Past Perfect Subjunctive <B>had been</B>,
and the Perfect conjugation with <B>would</B>, indicates that the condition
expressed in the clause <B>If he had been here</B> is false.

<CENTER><B>2. Formation of the subjunctive</B></CENTER><BR>

The English past and present tenses discussed in previous chapters are in
what is usually referred to as the <B>Indicative</B> Mood. Each of the past 
and present tenses in the Indicative Mood has a corresponding tense in the
<B>Subjunctive</B> Mood.<BR>
<BR>
In modern English, most verb tenses in the Subjunctive Mood are similar
or identical to the corresponding tenses in the Indicative Mood. It
should be noted that verbs in the Subjunctive Mood do not modify, but
have the same form regardless of the subject.<BR>
<BR>
The Simple Present Subjunctive and Simple Past Subjunctive of the verb
<B>to be</B> are shown below. The Indicative forms are also given, for
purposes of comparison. The Subjunctive forms which differ from the
corresponding Indicative forms are shown in bold type.<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
For any verb, the Simple Present Subjunctive is formed from the bare
infinitive of the verb.<BR>
<BR>
For any verb except the verb <B>to be</B>, the Simple Past Subjunctive is
identical to the Simple Past Indicative.<BR>
<BR>
For all of the past and present tenses conjugated with auxiliaries, the
Subjunctive tenses are formed in the same way as the Indicative tenses,
except that the Subjunctive of the auxiliaries is used.<BR>
<BR>
Using the example of the verb <B>to work</B>, the following table compares
the tenses of the Indicative and Subjunctive Moods. The Subjunctive
forms which differ from the corresponding Indicative forms are printed

<A NAME="3"></A>
<CENTER><B>3. Formal commands and requests</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
The Simple Present Subjunctive was once more extensively used than it
is today. In modern American English, the Simple Present Subjunctive
is still used in clauses beginning with the word <B>that</B> which express
formal commands or requests. In the following examples, the word <B>that</B> 
is printed in bold type, and the verbs in the Simple Present Subjunctive
are underlined.<BR>
e.g. They requested <B>that</B> she <U>arrive</U> early.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is important <B>that</B> they <U>be</U> present at the meeting.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The demand <B>that</B> he <U>provide</U> identification will create a delay.<BR>
<BR>
The main clauses of the preceding examples are <B>they requested</B>, <B>it is
important</B> and <B>the demand will create a delay</B>. In the first example,
the verb <B>requested</B> is in the Simple Past; in the second example, the
verb <B>is</B> is in the Simple Present; and in the third example, the verb
<B>will create</B> is in the Simple Future.<BR>
<BR>
As illustrated in these examples, the use of the Simple Present
Subjunctive in the subordinate clause of a formal command or request is
independent of the tense of the verb in the main clause.<BR>
<BR>
The Simple Present Subjunctive is more commonly used in formal English
than in informal English. For instance, the sentence &quot;He advises
<B>that</B> you not <U>be</U> late,&quot; is an example of formal English. In informal
English, the same idea would probably be expressed by the sentence
&quot;He advises you not <U>to be</U> late,&quot; in which the infinitive is used,
rather than a clause requiring the Simple Present Subjunctive.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex09.html#1">Exercise 1</A>.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="4"></A>
<CENTER><B>4. Wishes</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
The past tenses of the Subjunctive, and the auxiliary <B>would</B>, are used
in the subordinate clauses of sentences which use the verb <B>to wish</B> in
the main clause. In the following examples, the verb <B>to wish</B> is printed
in bold type, and the verbs in the subordinate clauses are underlined.<BR>
e.g. He <B>wishes</B> that he <U>were</U> rich.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They <B>wish</B> that they <U>had studied</U> harder when they were young.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She <B>wishes</B> that you <U>would come</U> to the meeting tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that the word <B>that</B> can be omitted from a sentence
which uses the verb <B>to wish</B> in the main clause.<BR>
e.g. He <B>wishes</B> he <U>were</U> rich.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They <B>wish</B> they <U>had studied</U> harder when they were young.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She <B>wishes</B> you <U>would come</U> to the meeting tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>
The form of the verb used in the subordinate clause of a wish is independent
of the tense of the verb in the main clause. As explained below, the form
of the verb used in the subordinate clause of a wish is determined by
whether the time of the action referred to in the subordinate clause is
earlier than, the same as, or later than the time of the action referred
to in the main clause.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 93-->
<A NAME="4a"></A>
<B>a. An earlier time</B><BR>
When the subordinate clause refers to an earlier time than the main clause,
the Past Perfect Subjunctive is usually used in the subordinate clause. In
the following examples, the verbs in the Past Perfect Subjunctive are
underlined.
<BR>
e.g. We <B>wished</B> he <U>had spoken</U> to us.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I <B>wish</B> you <U>had called</U> earlier.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They <B>will wish</B> they <U>had listened</U> to us sooner.<BR>
<BR>
In the case of a continuous, ongoing action, the Past Perfect Continuous
Subjunctive may be used instead of the Past Perfect Subjunctive. In the
following example, the verb in the Past Perfect Continuous Subjunctive is underlined.
<BR>
e.g. She <B>wishes</B> she <U>had been staying</U> with us last week.<BR>
<BR>
In each of these examples, the use of the Past Perfect Subjunctive or the
Past Perfect Continuous Subjunctive indicates that the subordinate clause
refers to an earlier time than the main clause.
<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex09.html#2">Exercise 2</A>.
<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4b"></A>
<B>b. The same time</B><BR>
When the subordinate clause refers to the same time as the main clause,
the Simple Past Subjunctive is usually used in the subordinate clause.
In the following examples, the verbs in the Simple Past Subjunctive are
underlined.<BR>
e.g. When she was at the party, she <B>wished</B> she <U>were</U> at home.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now that he is in China, he <B>wishes</B> he <U>understood</U> Chinese.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When we begin the trip, they <B>will wish</B> they <U>were</U> with us.<BR>
<BR>
In the case of a continuous, ongoing action, the Past Continuous Subjunctive
may be used instead of the Simple Past Subjunctive. In the following example,
the verb in the Past Continuous Subjunctive is underlined.<BR>
e.g. They <B>wish</B> they <U>were traveling</U> now.<BR>
<BR>
In each of these examples, the use of the Simple Past Subjunctive or the
Past Continuous Subjunctive indicates that the subordinate clause refers
to the same time as the main clause.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex09.html#3">Exercise 3</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4c"></A>
<B>c. A later time</B><BR>
When the subordinate clause refers to a later time than the main clause,
the Simple conjugation with the auxiliary <B>would</B> is usually used in the
subordinate clause. In the following examples, the verbs in the Simple
conjugation with <B>would</B> are underlined.<BR>
e.g. You <B>wished</B> she <U>would arrive</U> the next day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I <B>wish</B> she <U>would change</U> her mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He <B>will wish</B> we <U>would join</U> him the following week.<BR>
<BR>
In each of these examples, the use of the Simple conjugation with <B>would</B> 
indicates that the subordinate clause refers to a later time than the
main clause.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4e"></A>
<B>e. Use of the auxiliary Could in expressing wishes</B><BR>
It should be noted that the modal auxiliary <B>could</B>, which will be
discussed further in the next chapter, can also be used in the
subordinate clause of a sentence expressing a wish. The auxiliary
<B>could</B> forms conjugations in the same way as the auxiliary <B>would</B>.<BR>
e.g. I wish I <U>could help</U> you tomorrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wish I <U>could help</U> you now.<BR>
<BR>
As illustrated in the preceding examples, the Simple conjugation with
<B>could</B> may be used when the time referred to in the subordinate clause
is later than, or the same as, the time referred to in the main clause.<BR>
<BR>
As illustrated in the following example, the Perfect conjugation with
<B>could</B> may be used when the time referred to in the subordinate clause
is earlier than the time referred to in the main clause.<BR>
e.g. I wish I <U>could have helped</U> you yesterday.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="5"></A>
<CENTER><B>5. Conditions which are false or improbable</B></CENTER><BR>
Conditions are most often expressed in subordinate clauses beginning with
the word <B>if</B>. In the following examples, the word <B>if</B> is printed in
bold type.<BR>
e.g. <B>If</B> it had rained yesterday, we would have stayed at home.<BR>
The condition contained in this sentence is expressed in the subordinate
clause <B>if it had rained yesterday</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes the word <B>if</B> is omitted from a subordinate clause expressing
a condition. When the word <B>if</B> is omitted, the verb (in the case of
the Simple tenses of <B>to be</B>), or the first auxiliary, must be placed

<!--page 95-->
before the subject. The following pairs of sentences illustrate the
change in word order which occurs when the word <B>if</B> is omitted from
a clause expressing a condition. In these examples, the verbs of the
subordinate clauses are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <B>If</B> I <U>were</U> braver, I would challenge him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Were</U> I braver, I would challenge him.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>If</B> they <U>had been expecting</U> us, they would have arranged to meet us.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Had</U> they <U>been expecting</U> us, they would have arranged to meet us.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>If</B> I <U>had</U> not <U>received</U> your message, I would have left.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Had</U> I not <U>received</U> your message, I would have left.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex09.html#6">Exercise 6</A>.<BR>
<BR>
As well as being expressed in subordinate clauses beginning with the
word <B>if</B>, conditions may also be expressed in subordinate clauses
beginning with the word <B>unless</B>.<BR>
e.g. <B>Unless</B> he were a giant, he would not be able to see over the wall.<BR>
<BR>
Either the Indicative Mood or the Subjunctive Mood can be used to
express a condition.<BR>
<BR>
In the case of a condition which is considered true or probable, the
Indicative Mood is used.<BR>
e.g. If she <U>is</U> here now, we will ask her opinion.<BR>
In this example, the verb <B>is</B> is in the Simple Present Indicative.
The use of the Simple Present Indicative indicates that the condition
<B>if she is here now</B> is considered to be probable.<BR>
<BR>
In the case of a condition which is considered false or improbable,
the Subjunctive Mood is used.<BR>
e.g. If she <U>were</U> here now, we would ask her opinion.<BR>
In this example, the verb <B>were</B> is in the Simple Past Subjunctive.
The use of the Simple Past Subjunctive indicates that the condition
<B>if she were here now</B> is considered to be false or improbable.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5a"></A>
<B>a. Forms of the verb used in the main clause</B><BR>
When a sentence contains a condition which is considered false or
improbable, the verb in the main clause is usually in the Simple or
Perfect conjugation with the auxiliary <B>would</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5a1"></A>
<B>i. Referring to present or future time</B><BR>
In a sentence containing a false 
or improbable condition, if the main clause refers to present or future
time, the Simple conjugation with the auxiliary <B>would</B> is usually used.
In the following examples, the verbs in the Simple conjugation with
<B>would</B> are underlined.<BR>
e.g. If he were ready, I <U>would accompany</U> him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If she came, I <U>would lend</U> her my bicycle.<BR>
<BR>
In these examples, the use of the Simple conjugation with <B>would</B>
indicates that the main clauses <B>I would accompany him</B> and <B>I would
lend her my bicycle</B> refer to present or future time.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 96-->
In the case of a continuous, ongoing action, the Continuous conjugation
with <B>would</B> may be used. In the following examples, the verbs in the
Continuous conjugation with <B>would</B> are underlined.<BR>
e.g. If they were here, he <U>would be speaking</U> to them now.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If they arrived tomorrow, he <U>would be giving</U> them a tour of the city.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>

<A NAME="5a2"></A>
<B>ii. Referring to past time</B><BR>
In a sentence containing a false or improbable
condition, if the main clause refers to past time, the Perfect conjugation
with the auxiliary <B>would</B> is usually used. In the following example, the
verb in the Perfect conjugation with <B>would</B> is underlined.<BR>
e.g. If it had snowed, I <U>would have skied</U> in the park.<BR>
<BR>
In this example, the use of the Perfect conjugation with <B>would</B> indicates
that the main clause <B>I would have skied in the park</B> refers to past time.
The use of the Perfect conjugation with <B>would</B>, combined with the use of
the Past Perfect in the subordinate clause, indicates that the condition
<B>it had snowed</B> is false, and that the action of skiing did not take place.<BR>
<BR>
In the case of a continuous, ongoing action, the Perfect Continuous
conjugation with <B>would</B> may be used. In the following example, the
verb in the Perfect Continuous conjugation with <B>would</B> is underlined.<BR>
e.g. If they had been here, he <U>would have been speaking</U> to them.<BR>
<BR>

<B>iv. Use of the auxiliary Could in sentences containing false or
improbable Conditions</B><BR>
It should be noted that the auxiliary <B>could</B> can be used in either
the main clause or the subordinate clause of a sentence containing a

<!--page 97-->
false or improbable condition. The first pair of examples illustrates
the use of the auxiliary <B>could</B> in the main clause. The second pair of
examples illustrates the use of the auxiliary <B>could</B> in the subordinate
clause.<BR>
e.g. If they studied hard, they <U>could pass</U> the exam next year.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If they had studied hard, they <U>could have passed</U> the exam last year.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you <U>could see</U> me now, you would not recognize me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you <U>could have seen</U> me yesterday, you would not have recognized me.<BR>
<BR>
In these examples, the verbs <B>could pass</B> and <B>could see</B> are in the
Simple conjugation with <B>could</B>; and the verbs <B>could have passed</B> 
and <B>could have seen</B> are in the Perfect conjugation with <B>could</B>. As
illustrated in these examples, the Simple conjugation with <B>could</B> may be
used to refer to present or future time; whereas the Perfect conjugation
with <B>could</B> may be used to refer to past time.<BR>

<A NAME="5b1"></A>
<B>i. Referring to present or future time</B><BR>
In a sentence containing a false
or improbable condition, if the subordinate clause refers to present or
future time, the Simple Past Subjunctive is usually used. In the
following examples, the verbs in the Simple Past Subjunctive are
underlined.<BR>
e.g. If it <U>snowed</U>, I would ski in the park.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he <U>were</U> here, I would give him the books.<BR>
<BR>
In these examples, the use of the Simple Past Subjunctive indicates that
the subordinate clauses <B>if it snowed</B> and <B>if he were here</B> refer to
present or future time.<BR>
<BR>
In the case of a continuous, ongoing action, the Past Continuous
Subjunctive may be used. In the following example, the verb in the
Past Continuous Subjunctive is underlined.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If she <U>were staying</U> here now, I would let her ride my horse.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex09.html#10">Exercise 10</A>.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that, in the case of the verb <B>to be</B>, in informal
English, the Simple Past Indicative is often used instead of the Simple
Past Subjunctive. For instance, the following pair of examples shows
how the same idea might be expressed in formal and informal English.<BR>
<BR>
<U>Formal</U>: If he <U>were</U> here now, I would give him the books.<BR>
<U>Informal</U>: If he <U>was</U> here now, I would give him the books.
<BR>
<BR>
It should be observed that, even when the Indicative is used instead of
the Subjunctive, the use of a past tense for an action pertaining to
present time, combined with the use of the conjugation with <B>would</B> in
the main clause, is enough to indicate clearly that the condition expressed
is considered false or improbable. However, this use of <B>was</B> instead of
<B>were</B> is considered grammatically incorrect in formal English.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 98-->
<A NAME="5b2"></A>
<B>ii. Referring to past time</B><BR>
In a sentence containing a false or improbable
condition, if the subordinate clause refers to past time, the Past Perfect
Subjunctive is usually used. In the following example, the verb in the
Past Perfect Subjunctive is underlined.<BR>
e.g. If he <U>had wanted</U> to come, he would have called us.<BR>
<BR>
In this example, the use of the Past Perfect Subjunctive indicates that
the subordinate clause <B>if he had wanted to come</B> refers to past time.
The use of the Past Perfect Subjunctive also indicates that the condition
<B>he had wanted to come</B> is false.<BR>
<BR>
In the case of a continuous, ongoing action, the Past Perfect Continuous
Subjunctive may be used. In the following example, the verb in the Past
Perfect Continuous Subjunctive is underlined.<BR>
e.g. If it <U>had been raining</U> yesterday, I would have taken my umbrella.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex09.html#11">Exercise 11</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<B>c. Changing a statement containing a probable condition into a statement containing an improbable condition</B><BR>
A statement containing a probable condition can be changed into a statement
containing an improbable condition, by changing the forms of the verbs.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, in each of the following pairs of examples, the first
statement contains a probable condition; whereas the second statement
contains an improbable condition. The verbs in the subordinate clauses
and main clauses are underlined.<BR>
<BR>
<U>Probable</U>: If he <U>is</U> here now, we <U>will give</U> him the book.<BR>
<U>Improbable</U>: If he <U>were</U> here now, we <U>would give</U> him the book.<BR>
<BR>
<U>Probable</U>: If I <U>have</U> time tonight, I <U>will help</U> you with your homework.<BR>
<U>Improbable</U>: If I <U>had</U> time tonight, I <U>would help</U> you with your homework.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 99-->
In these examples, <B>he is here now</B> and <B>I have time tonight</B> express
probable conditions; whereas <B>he were here now</B> and <B>I had time</B> tonight 
express improbable conditions.<BR>
<BR>
These examples illustrate how, when referring to non-continuous actions
in present or future time, a statement containing a probable condition
can be changed into a statement containing an improbable condition.
The verb in the subordinate clause is changed from the Simple Present
Indicative to the Simple Past Subjunctive; and the verb in the
main clause is changed from the Simple Future to the Simple conjugation
with <B>would</B>.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex09.html#13">Exercise 13</A>.<BR>
<BR>
It is sometimes said that when a verb is in the Indicative Mood, the use
of a past tense indicates remoteness in terms of time; however, when a
verb is in the Subjunctive Mood, the use of a past tense indicates
remoteness in terms of probability.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="6"></A>
<CENTER><B>6. The imperative mood</B></CENTER><BR>
The Imperative Mood is used for giving commands. Like the Simple Present
Subjunctive, the Imperative Mood of a verb is formed from the bare infinitive
of the verb. For instance, the Imperative of the verb <B>to work</B> is <B>work</B>.
In the following examples, the verbs in the Imperative Mood are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <U>Work</U>!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Work</U> harder!<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, the Imperative of the verb <B>to be</B> is <B>be</B>.<BR>
e.g. <U>Be</U> more alert!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You <U>be</U> ready to come with us.<BR>
<BR>
The Imperative Mood can be used only in the second person. As shown
in the first three examples above, the subject of the sentence is often
omitted when the Imperative Mood is used. In such sentences, the subject
<B>you</B> is said to be &quot;understood&quot;. In written English, when the subject of
the verb is omitted from a command, the command is often followed by an
exclamation mark: <B>!</B><BR>
<BR>
The Imperative Mood can also be used in negative statements. Negative
statements are formed using the auxiliary <B>do</B>, followed by the word <B>not</B>.
The contraction <B>don't</B> is often used in spoken English. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contractions</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Do not work so hard.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Don't work so hard.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Do not be afraid.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Don't be afraid.</TD></TR>
