<A NAME="1"></A>
<CENTER><B>1. Uses of the auxiliary Would</B></CENTER><BR>

English verbs conjugated </B>with the auxiliary <B>would</B> are used in a
variety of ways. For instance, the auxiliary <B>would</B> is often used
in polite requests and suggestions. In the following examples, the
verbs conjugated with <B>would</B> are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <U>Would</U> you please <U>tell</U> me the time?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps it <U>would be</U> a good idea to call the office.<BR>
<BR>
The auxiliary <B>would</B> can also express a <B>future in the past</B>, and is
used in reporting statements and questions which pertained to the future
at the time they were made.<BR>
e.g. She asked if we <U>would help</U> her the next day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They said they <U>would arrange</U> to meet us the following week.<BR>
<BR>
The auxiliary <B>would</B> can also be used in wishes pertaining to the
future, and in the main clauses of sentences containing false or
improbable conditions. These two uses of the auxiliary <B>would</B> will
be discussed in the next chapter.<BR>
e.g. I wish they <U>would help</U> us.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It <U>would have saved</U> time if I had known what to do.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="2"></A>
<CENTER><B>2. Formation of conjugations with the auxiliary Would</B></CENTER><BR>

There are four types of conjugation formed with the auxiliary <B>would</B>: the Simple, the Continuous, the Perfect, and the Perfect Continuous.<BR>
<BR>
The conjugations with <B>would</B> are formed in the same way as the Future
conjugations, except that instead of <B>will</B> and <B>shall</B>, <B>would</B> and
<B>should</B> are used. In the conjugations with <B>would</B>, <B>should</B> may be
used for the first person in British English; however, <B>would</B> is normally
used for the first person in American English.<BR>
<BR>
Like <B>will</B> and <B>shall</B>, <B>would</B> is a modal auxiliary. When verbs are
conjugated with modal auxiliaries, the results are sometimes referred to
as <B>moods</B> rather than tenses.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2a"></A>
<B>a. The simple conjugation with the auxiliary Would</B><BR>
The Simple conjugation with the auxiliary <B>would</B> is used to express
non-continuous actions.<BR>
<BR>
In spoken English, the auxiliary <B>would</B> is frequently contracted to <B>'d</B>.
It should be noted that this contraction is the same as that used for <B>had</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2aco"></A>
In the case of the verb <B>to work</B>, the Simple conjugation with the
auxiliary <B>would</B> is as follows:<BR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; they would work</TD><TD>&nbsp; they'd work</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
The contraction <B>it'd</B> is used less frequently than the other contractions,
since it is more difficult to pronounce.<BR>
<BR>
As illustrated below, the word order for questions and negative statements
in the Simple conjugation with the auxiliary <B>would</B> is similar to that in
other English conjugations. The negative tag questions are underlined.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="2awo"></A>
In spoken English, <B>would not</B> is frequently contracted to <B>wouldn't</B>.<BR>

polite requests and suggestions.<BR>
e.g. <U>Would</U> you please <U>pass</U> the butter?<BR>

Unlike the Perfect conjugations in the English past, present, and
future tenses, the Perfect conjugation with the auxiliary <B>would</B> is
<U>not</U> generally used to express an action completed by a certain time.<BR>
<BR>
Instead, the Perfect conjugation with the auxiliary <B>would</B> may be used
as a past form of the Simple conjugation with the auxiliary <B>would</B>.
The verbs in the following examples are underlined.<BR>

<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<BR>
In the first example, the Perfect conjugation <B>would have liked</B> is used

form of the Simple conjugation <B>would write</B>.<BR>

<CENTER><B>4. The &quot;future in the past&quot;</B></CENTER><BR>
The modal auxiliary <B>would</B> is the past form of the modal auxiliary
<B>will</B>. For this reason, the auxiliary <B>would</B> can be used to form
what is sometimes called a <B>future in the past</B>.<BR>
<BR>
The <B>future in the past</B> is used in reporting statements and questions
which pertained to the future at the time they were made. In the
following examples, the verbs in the main clauses are printed in bold
type, and the verbs in the subordinate clauses are underlined.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Tense of Verb in Main Clause</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Complete Sentence</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Simple Present</TD><TD>&nbsp; I <B>think</B> you <U>will succeed</U>.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Simple Past</TD><TD>&nbsp; I <B>thought</B> you <U>would succeed</U>.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>

In the sentence <B>I think you will succeed,</B> the verb of the main clause,
<B>think</B>, is in the Simple Present, and the verb of the subordinate clause,
<B>will succeed</B>, is in the Simple Future. If the verb <B>think</B> is changed
to the Simple Past, then the verb <B>will succeed</B> must also be put into
the past, by using the auxiliary <B>would</B> instead of <B>will</B>.<BR>
<BR>
The following are other examples of the use of the <B>future in the past</B>:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Tense of Verb in Main Clause</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Complete Sentence</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Simple Present</TD><TD>&nbsp; She <B>says</B> she <U>will visit</U> us next week.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Simple Past</TD><TD>&nbsp; She <B>said</B> she <U>would visit</U> us the following week.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Simple Present</TD><TD>&nbsp; They <B>know</B> that we <U>will be arriving</U> tomorrow.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Simple Past</TD><TD>&nbsp; They <B>knew</B> that we <U>would be arriving</U> the next day.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
In both pairs of examples, when the verb in the main clause is changed
from the Simple Present to the Simple Past, the verb in the subordinate
clause is changed from a future tense to the <B>future in the past</B>, by
changing the auxiliary <B>will</B> to <B>would</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 81-->
It should be noted that adverb and adverb phrases such as <B>tomorrow</B>,
<B>yesterday</B> and <B>next year</B> can be used only with reference to present
time. When used with reference to past or future time, as in reported
speech, these adverbs and adverb phrases must be changed.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, <B>tomorrow</B> must be changed to an expression such as <B>the
next day</B> or <B>the following day</B>; and <B>next year</B> must be changed to
an expression such as <B>the next year</B> or <B>the following year</B>. Other
examples are given in the table below.<BR>
