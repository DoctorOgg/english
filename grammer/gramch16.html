<!--page 173-->
Some English nouns usually cannot form a plural or be preceded by <B>a</B>,
<B>an</B> or a number. Because they usually cannot be preceded by a number,
such nouns can be referred to as <B>uncountable</B>. English uncountable
nouns include:<BR>
<BR>
<B>a)</B> nouns naming intangible things which normally cannot be counted:<BR>
e.g. honesty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; courage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; impatience<BR>
<BR>
<B>b)</B> nouns naming tangible things which are thought of as substances:<BR>
e.g. butter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; milk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sand<BR>
<BR>
<B>c)</B> nouns naming groups of things which in English are referred to collectively:<BR>
e.g. furniture<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; luggage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; news<BR>
<BR>
<B>d)</B> names of languages:<BR>
e.g. English<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; German<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spanish<BR>
<BR>
An uncountable noun takes a singular verb.<BR>
e.g. Honesty <U>is</U> a virtue.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Butter <U>tastes</U> good.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Furniture <U>was</U> provided.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="1"></A>
<CENTER><B>1. The absence of a determiner before uncountable nouns</B></CENTER><BR>

<A NAME="1a"></A>
<B>a. Making a general statement</B><BR>
In general statements, uncountable nouns are usually not preceded by
determiners. The uncountable nouns in the following general statements
are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <U>Information</U> is often valuable.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Butter</U> is fattening.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Courage</U> and <U>honesty</U> are admirable qualities.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Sunlight</U> and <U>water</U> are usually required for plants to grow.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1b"></A>
<B>b. Referring to something not mentioned before</B><BR>
In descriptions, uncountable nouns are generally not preceded by a
determiner when naming something which has not been referred to
previously.<BR>
e.g. <U>Rain</U> was forecast for the next day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, <U>thunder</U> and <U>lightning</U> were not expected.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our breakfast consisted of <U>bread,</U> <U>honey</U> and <U>marmalade</U>.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 174-->
In these examples, the uncountable nouns <B>rain</B>, <B>thunder</B>, <B>lightning</B>,
<B>bread</B>, <B>honey</B> and <B>marmalade</B> are not preceded by determiners. It is
assumed that the things referred to by these nouns have not been
mentioned previously.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex16.html#1">Exercise 1</A>.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="2"></A>
<CENTER><B>2. The use of The before uncountable nouns</B></CENTER><BR>

<A NAME="2a"></A>
<B>a. Referring to something mentioned before</B><BR>
<B>The</B> is used with uncountable nouns referring to things previously
mentioned.<BR>
e.g. We were served <U>bread</U> and <U>cheese</U>. <U>The bread</U> was somewhat stale, but
<U>the cheese</U> was delicious.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Gold</U> was discovered in the Klondike. <U>The gold</U> attracted thousands
of prospectors.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Furniture</U> and <U>clothing</U> are being sold at the flea market.
<U>The furniture</U> is reasonably priced, and <U>the clothing</U> is cheap.<BR>
<BR>
In these examples, the first time the uncountable nouns <B>bread</B>,
<B>cheese</B>, <B>gold</B>, <B>furniture</B> and <B>clothing</B> are used, they are not
preceded by determiners, because the things referred to have not been
mentioned previously. The second time these nouns are used, they are
preceded by <B>the</B>, since the things referred to have already been
mentioned.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex16.html#2">Exercise 2</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2b"></A>
<B>b. Referring to something when it is considered obvious what is meant</B><BR>
<B>The</B> is used with uncountable nouns when the speaker or writer
considers it obvious which particular thing is meant.<BR>
e.g. <U>The weather</U> is fine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>The butter</U> is hard.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>The music</U> is too loud.<BR>
The expression <B>the weather</B> usually refers to the local weather. The
expression <B>the butter</B> could refer to butter which one plans to use,
and the expression <B>the music</B> could refer to music which is playing
nearby.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The</B> is often used before uncountable nouns followed by descriptive
phrases, since such phrases tend to make it clear to which particular
things the uncountable nouns are referring.<BR>
e.g. <U>The warmth</U> of the sun causes water to evaporate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>The coal</U> mined in Germany is used in making steel.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>The milk</U> which they produce is marketed locally.<BR>
<BR>
In the first sentence, <B>the</B> is used with the uncountable noun <B>warmth</B>,
since the phrase <B>of the sun</B> specifies what warmth is meant. In the
second sentence, <B>the</B> is used with the uncountable noun <B>coal</B>, since
the phrase <B>mined in Germany</B> specifies which particular coal is meant.
In the third sentence, <B>the</B> is used with the uncountable noun <B>milk</B>,
since the phrase <B>which they produce</B> makes it clear which particular
milk is meant.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 175-->
As shown in the following table, the absence of a determiner and the use
of <B>the</B> before uncountable nouns follows a pattern similar to the absence
of a determiner and the use of <B>the</B> before plural countable nouns.<BR>

<CENTER><B>3. The use of uncountable nouns to refer to individual things</B></CENTER><BR>

Uncountable nouns can be used to refer to individual things by being
preceded by a countable noun and the word <B>of</B>. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Uncountable Noun</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Referring to an Individual Thing</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; information</TD><TD>&nbsp; a piece of information</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; wheat</TD><TD>&nbsp; a grain of wheat</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; milk</TD><TD>&nbsp; a glass of milk</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; sunlight</TD><TD>&nbsp; a patch of sunlight</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
The countable nouns may, of course, be put into the plural. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Singular</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Plural</B></U></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp; one piece of information</TD><TD>&nbsp; two pieces of information</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; one grain of wheat</TD><TD>&nbsp; three grains of wheat</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; one glass of milk</TD><TD>&nbsp; four glasses of milk</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; one patch of sunlight</TD><TD>&nbsp; five patches of sunlight</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
In sentences such as the following, it is the countable noun which is
the subject of the verb.
<BR>
e.g. Fifty <U>grains</U> of wheat <U>are</U> required.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two <U>glasses</U> of milk <U>are</U> enough.<BR>
In the above examples, the plural countable nouns <B>grains</B> and <B>glasses</B>
each take the plural verb <B>are</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In English, the names of games are usually uncountable nouns.<BR>
e.g. He plays <U>hockey</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Chess</U> is a challenging game.<BR>
<BR>
When it is desired to refer to individual games, the word <B>game</B> must
usually be used. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Uncountable Noun</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Referring to an Individual Thing</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; chess</TD><TD>&nbsp; a game of chess</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; hockey</TD><TD>&nbsp; a game of hockey <B>or </B>a hockey game</TD></TR>

<CENTER><B>4. Nouns which can be either countable or uncountable</B></CENTER><BR>

Many English nouns are used sometimes as countable nouns and sometimes
as uncountable nouns. Nouns which can be either countable or uncountable
include nouns which may have different shades of meaning; normally
uncountable nouns which are used to refer to types of things; and a
few nouns which refer to places used for specific activities.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4a"></A>
<B>a. Differences in meaning</B><BR>
Many nouns are uncountable when they refer to something as a substance
or a concept, but are countable when they refer to an individual thing
related to the substance or concept. For instance, <B>cake</B> is used as an
uncountable noun when referring to cake as a substance, but is used as a
countable noun when referring to individual cakes.<BR>
e.g. <U>Cake</U> and ice cream is my favorite dessert.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This afternoon we baked two <U>cakes</U>.<BR>
In the first sentence <B>cake</B> is an uncountable noun, and in the second
sentence <B>cakes</B> is a countable noun.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, <B>life</B> is used as an uncountable noun when referring to life
as an abstract concept, but is used as a countable noun when referring
to individual lives.<BR>
e.g. <U>Life</U> is full of surprises.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was feared that two <U>lives</U> had been lost.<BR>
In the first sentence <B>life</B> is an uncountable noun, and in the second
sentence <B>lives</B> is a countable noun.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4b"></A>
<B>b. Referring to a type of something</B><BR>
An uncountable noun can be used as countable noun when it refers to a
type of something.<BR>
e.g. He has <U>an honesty</U> which is rare nowadays.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The <U>wheats</U> of Canada differ from those of India.<BR>
In the first sentence, the usually uncountable noun <B>honesty</B> is used
with <B>an</B> as a countable noun to refer to a type of honesty. In the
second sentence, the usually uncountable noun <B>wheat</B> is used as a
countable noun in the plural to refer to types of wheat.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4c"></A>
<B>c. Referring to places used for specific activities</B><BR>
A few nouns referring to places used for specific activities can be
either countable or uncountable. These nouns are used as uncountable
nouns when referring to places as locations where specific activities
are carried out, but are used as countable nouns when referring to the
places as objects. In the following pairs of sentences, the words
<B>bed</B> and <B>church</B> are used first as uncountable nouns, and then as
countable nouns.<BR>
e.g. Because I was tired, I stayed in <U>bed</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please help me to move <U>the bed</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She goes to <U>church</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She likes to photograph <U>churches</U>.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 177-->
In the first pair of sentences, <B>stayed in bed</B> refers to the activity
of resting in bed; whereas <B>move the bed</B> refers to a bed as an object.
In the second pair of sentences, <B>goes to church</B> refers to the activity
of taking part in church services; whereas <B>likes to photograph churches</B>
refers to churches as objects.<BR>
<BR>
Nouns which are used in this way include:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD>&nbsp; bed</TD><TD>&nbsp; home</TD><TD>&nbsp; sea</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; church</TD><TD>&nbsp; hospital</TD><TD>&nbsp; town</TD></TR>

<A NAME="4d"></A>
<B>d. Names of meals</B><BR>
Similarly, the word <B>television</B> and the names of meals such as <B>breakfast</B>,
<B>lunch</B>, <B>dinner</B> and <B>supper</B> are used as uncountable nouns when it is
desired to emphasize the activity being carried out.<BR>
e.g. They are watching <U>television</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are eating <U>breakfast</U>.<BR>
<BR>

&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="5"></A>
<CENTER><B>5. Infinitives used in the place of nouns</B></CENTER><BR>

Infinitives are sometimes used in the place of nouns.<BR>
e.g. <U>To ski</U> well is one of my goals.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They plan <U>to call</U> us.<BR>
<BR>
In the first sentence, the infinitive <B>to ski</B> performs the function of
a noun, since it is the subject of the verb <B>is</B>. In the second
sentence, the infinitive <B>to call</B> performs the function of a noun,
since it is the object of the verb <B>to plan</B>. These infinitives also
function as verbs, since <B>to ski</B> is described by the adverb <B>well</B>, and
<B>to call</B> takes the object <B>us</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Like an uncountable noun, an infinitive which is the subject of a verb
takes a singular verb. Unlike an uncountable noun, an infinitive
usually cannot be preceded by the word <B>the</B>.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="6"></A>
<CENTER><B>6. Gerunds</B></CENTER><BR>

Present participles are often used in the place of nouns. A present
participle used in the place of a noun is usually referred to as a
<B>gerund</B>. In the following sentences, the gerunds are underlined.<BR>
e.g. <U>Skating</U> is good exercise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They like <U>jogging</U>.<BR>
In the first sentence, <B>skating</B> is the subject of the verb <B>is</B>. In
the second sentence, <B>jogging</B> is the object of the verb <B>like</B>.<BR>
<BR>
A gerund can perform the functions of a noun and a verb at the same time.<BR>
e.g. <U>Riding</U> a bicycle is good exercise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They like <U>playing</U> hockey.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 178-->
In the first sentence, the gerund <B>riding</B> functions as a noun, since it
is the subject of the verb <B>is</B>; and also functions as a verb, since it
takes the object <B>bicycle</B>. In the second sentence, the gerund <B>playing</B>
functions as a noun, since it is the object of the verb <B>like</B>; and
also functions as a verb, since it takes the object <B>hockey</B>.<BR>
<BR>
In their role as nouns, gerunds are sometimes regarded as uncountable
nouns. Like an uncountable noun, a gerund which is the subject of a
verb takes a singular verb. Also, like an uncountable noun, a gerund
can be preceded by <B>the</B> when referring to a particular thing or to
something previously mentioned.<BR>
e.g. <U>The skiing</U> was excellent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He went hunting. <U>The hunting</U> was good.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, <B>the skiing</B> could refer to skiing done at a
particular place. In the second example, <B>the hunting</B> refers to the
hunting mentioned in the previous sentence.<P>

<A NAME="7a"></A>
<B>a. Verbs followed by infinitives</B><BR>
Many English verbs can be followed by an infinitive. In the following
examples, the verbs are underlined, and the infinitives are printed in
bold type.<BR>
e.g. They <U>want</U> <B>to succeed</B>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He <U>hopes</U> <B>to travel</B> next year.<BR>
