<A NAME="1"></A>
<CENTER><B>1. Summary of the uses of the English tenses</B></CENTER><BR>
There are four types of verb tense in English: the Simple, the Continuous,
the Perfect, and the Perfect Continuous. Each type of tense has a Present,
a Past, and a Future form, as well as other modal forms.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, just as there are four present tenses in English, there are also
four past tenses: the Simple Past, the Past Continuous, the Past Perfect,
and the Past Perfect Continuous.<BR>
<BR>
As will be shown below, the three forms of each type of tense are
closely related in terms of their use and formation. For instance, the
Present Continuous, Past Continuous, and Future Continuous tenses are
all used to express continuous, ongoing actions; and are all formed from
the verb <B>to be</B> followed by the present participle. The differences
are that the Present Continuous is formed with the Simple Present of the
verb <B>to be</B>, and is used mainly to express present actions; the Past
Continuous is formed with the Simple Past of the verb <B>to be</B>, and is
used to express past actions; and the Future Continuous is formed with
the Simple Future of the verb <B>to be</B>, and is used to express future
actions.<BR>
<BR>
The uses of the Simple, Continuous, Perfect, and Perfect Continuous
tenses are summarized in the following table.<BR>
<BR>

</TABLE><P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="2"></A>
<CENTER><B>2. The past continuous</B></CENTER><BR>

<A NAME="2a"></A>
<B>a. Use</B><BR>
The Past Continuous tense is used to express continuous, ongoing
actions which took place in the past. In the following examples,
the verbs in the Past Continuous tense are underlined.<BR>
e.g. He <U>was traveling</U> in Europe last summer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They <U>were playing</U> tennis yesterday afternoon.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 46-->
The Past Continuous tense is frequently used to refer to an ongoing
action which was taking place when something else occurred in the past.<BR>
e.g. I <U>was washing</U> the dishes when the telephone rang.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We <U>were entertaining</U> friends when the parcel arrived.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the use of the Past Continuous tense indicates
that the action of washing the dishes was taking place at the time when
the telephone rang. In the second example, the use of the Past
Continuous tense indicates that the action of entertaining friends
was taking place at the time when the parcel arrived.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2b"></A>
<B>b. Formation</B><BR>
The Past Continuous tense is formed from the Simple Past of the auxiliary
<B>to be</B>, followed by the present participle of the verb. For example,
the Past Continuous of the verb <B>to work</B> is conjugated as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>I was working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>you were working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>he was working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>she was working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>it was working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>we were working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>they were working</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex06.html#1">Exercise 1</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2c"></A>
<B>c. Questions and negative statements</B><BR>
As is the case with other English tenses, questions and negative
statements in the Past Continuous are formed using the auxiliary.<BR>
<BR>
Questions are formed by placing the auxiliary before the subject. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I was working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Was I working?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They were working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Were they working?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Negative statements are formed by placing the word <B>not</B> after the<BR>
auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Negative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I was working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; I was not working.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They were working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They were not working.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
In spoken English, the contractions <B>wasn't</B> and <B>weren't</B> are often used.<BR>
<BR>
Negative questions are formed by placing the auxiliary before the subject,
and the word <B>not</B> after the subject. However, when contractions are
used, the contracted form of <B>not</B> immediately follows the auxiliary. The
following are examples of negative questions with and without contractions:<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 47-->
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contractions</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Was I not working?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Wasn't I working?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Were they not working?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Weren't they working?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Tag questions are formed using the auxiliary. In the following examples,
the negative tag questions are underlined. Contractions are usually used
in negative tag questions. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement with Tag Question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I was working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; I was working, <U>wasn't I</U>?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They were working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They were working, <U>weren't they</U>?</TD></TR>

<A NAME="3"></A>
<CENTER><B>3. The past perfect</B></CENTER><BR>

<A NAME="3a"></A>
<B>a. Use</B><BR>
The Past Perfect tense is used to refer to a non-continuous action in the
past, which was already completed by the time another action in the past
took place. In the following examples, the verbs in the Past Perfect
tense are underlined.<BR>
e.g. She <U>had heard</U> the news before I saw her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I <U>had finished</U> my work by the time the clock struck twelve.<BR>
<BR>
In the preceding examples, the verbs <B>had heard</B> and <B>had finished</B> are
in the Past Perfect tense, and the verbs <B>saw</B> and <B>struck</B> are in the
Simple Past. The use of the Past Perfect tense indicates that the actions
of hearing the news and finishing the work were already completed by the
time the actions expressed by the verbs in the Simple Past took place.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3b"></A>
<B>b. Formation</B><BR>
The Past Perfect tense is formed from the Simple Past of the auxiliary
<B>to have</B>, followed by the past participle of the verb.<BR>
<BR>
The Simple Past of <B>to have</B> is <B>had</B>. In spoken English, the auxiliary
<B>had</B> is often contracted to <B>'d</B>. For example, the Past Perfect of the
verb <B>to work</B> is conjugated as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contractions</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I had worked</TD><TD>&nbsp; I'd worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; you had worked</TD><TD>&nbsp; you'd worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; he had worked</TD><TD>&nbsp; he'd worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; she had worked</TD><TD>&nbsp; she'd worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; it had worked</TD><TD>&nbsp; it'd worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; we had worked</TD><TD>&nbsp; we'd worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; they had worked</TD><TD>&nbsp; they'd worked</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>

<!--page 48-->
The contraction <B>it'd</B> is less frequently used than the other
contractions, since it is more difficult to pronounce.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex06.html#4">Exercise 4</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3c"></A>
<B>c. Questions and negative statements</B><BR>
As is the case with other English tenses, questions and negative
statements in the Past Perfect tense are formed using the auxiliary.<BR>
<BR>
Questions are formed by placing the auxiliary before the subject. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I had worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Had I worked?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They had worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Had they worked?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Negative statements are formed by placing the word <B>not</B> after the
auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Negative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I had worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; I had not worked.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They had worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They had not worked.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
<A NAME="3cha"></A>
In spoken English, the following contraction is often used:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contraction</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contraction</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; had not</TD><TD>&nbsp; hadn't</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Negative questions are formed by placing the auxiliary before the subject,
and the word <B>not</B> after the subject. However, when contractions are used,
the contracted form of <B>not</B> follows immediately after the auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contraction</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contraction</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Had I not worked?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Hadn't I worked?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Had they not worked?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Hadn't they worked?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Tag questions are formed using the auxiliary. In the following examples,
the negative tag questions are underlined. Contractions are usually used
in negative tag questions.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement with Tag Question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I had worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; I had worked, <U>hadn't I</U>?</TD></TR>

<A NAME="4"></A>
<CENTER><B>4. The past perfect continuous</B></CENTER><BR>

<A NAME="4a"></A>
<B>a. Use</B><BR>
The Past Perfect Continuous tense is used to refer to a continuous,
ongoing action in the past which was already completed by the time
another action in the past took place. In the following examples, the
verbs in the Past Perfect Continuous tense are underlined.<BR>
e.g. I <U>had been waiting</U> for two months by the time I received the reply.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He <U>had been thinking</U> about his friends shortly before they called.<BR>
<BR>
In the preceding examples, the verbs <B>had been waiting</B> and <B>had been
thinking</B> are in the Past Perfect Continuous tense, and the verbs
<B>received</B> and <B>called</B> are in the Simple Past. The use of the Past
Perfect Continuous tense indicates that the actions of waiting and
thinking were continuous, and were completed by the time the actions
expressed by the verbs in the Simple Past took place.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4b"></A>
<B>b. Formation</B><BR>
The Past Perfect Continuous tense is formed from the Past Perfect of the
auxiliary <B>to be</B>, followed by the present participle of the verb. For
example, the Past Perfect Continuous tense of the verb <B>to work</B> is
conjugated as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>I had been working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>you had been working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>he had been working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>she had been working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>it had been working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>we had been working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>they had been working</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<BR>
The auxiliary <B>had</B> is often contracted to <B>'d</B> in spoken English.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex06.html#7">Exercise 7</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4c"></A>
<B>c. Questions and negative statements</B><BR>
As is the case with other English tenses, questions and negative
statements in the Past Perfect Continuous tense are formed using
the first auxiliary.<BR>
<BR>
Questions are formed by placing the first auxiliary before the subject. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I had been working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Had I been working?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They had been working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Had they been working?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Negative statements are formed by placing the word <B>not</B> after the
first auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Negative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I had been working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; I had not been working.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They had been working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They had not been working.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>

<!--page 50-->
Negative questions are formed by placing the first auxiliary before the
subject, and the word <B>not</B> after the subject. However, when contractions
are used, the contracted form of <B>not</B> follows immediately after the
first auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contractions</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Had I not been working?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Hadn't I been working?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Had they not been working?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Hadn't they been working?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Tag questions are formed using the first auxiliary. In the following
examples, the negative tag questions are underlined. Contractions are
usually used in negative tag questions.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement with Tag Question</B></U></TD></TR>

<BR>


* In the Simple Present and Simple Past tenses, the auxiliaries are
used only for emphasis, and for the formation of questions and negative
statements. Auxiliaries are never used with the Simple Present or
Simple Past of the verb <B>to be</B>.<BR>
<BR>
** When used without the auxiliary, the third person singular of the
Simple Present has the ending <B>s</B>.<BR>
<BR>
*** When the verb is used without the auxiliary, the Simple Past form of
the verb is used. For regular verbs, and for many irregular verbs, the
Simple Past has the same form as the past participle.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex06.html#10">Exercise 10</A>.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<!--page 51-->
<A NAME="6"></A>
<CENTER><B>6. Emphatic statements</B></CENTER><BR>

In spoken English, words can be emphasized by being pronounced with a
heavier stress than usual. This type of emphasis is usually indicated
in written English by means of italics or underlining. In the following
examples, emphasized words are indicated by means of underlining.<BR>
<BR>
Emphatic statements are often used in conversation; for instance, when
one speaker is contradicting another.<BR>
e.g. &quot;I don't believe he works very hard.&quot;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Yes, he <U>does</U> work hard.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
When it is desired to emphasize a verb, it is generally the first auxiliary
which is stressed. For instance, in the sentence <B>I am working hard</B>, the verb can be emphasized by stressing the auxiliary <B>am</B>.<BR>
e.g. I <U>am</U> working hard.<BR>
<BR>
Usually, no auxiliary is required for affirmative statements in the
Simple Present and Simple Past. However, in order to make such statements
emphatic, for verbs other than the verb <B>to be</B>, the auxiliary <B>to do</B> is
used, followed by the bare infinitive. For example, in the Simple Present,
the emphatic form of the verb <B>to work</B> is formed with the Simple Present
of the auxiliary <B>to do</B>, as shown below:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Emphatic Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I work.</TD><TD>&nbsp; I <U>do</U> work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; You work.</TD><TD>&nbsp; You <U>do</U> work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; He works.</TD><TD>&nbsp; He <U>does</U> work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; She works.</TD><TD>&nbsp; She <U>does</U> work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It works.</TD><TD>&nbsp; It <U>does</U> work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; We work.</TD><TD>&nbsp; We <U>do</U> work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They work.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They <U>do</U> work.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
In the Simple Past, the emphatic form of the verb <B>to work</B> is formed
with the Simple Past of the auxiliary <B>to do</B>, as shown below:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Emphatic Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; I <U>did</U> work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; You worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; You <U>did</U> work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; He worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; He <U>did</U> work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; She worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; She <U>did</U> work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; It <U>did</U> work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; We worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; We <U>did</U> work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They <U>did</U> work.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
For the emphatic form of the Simple Present of the verb <B>to be</B>, no
auxiliary is used. Instead, the verb itself is stressed. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Emphatic Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I am ready.</TD><TD>&nbsp; I <U>am</U> ready.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It is ready.</TD><TD>&nbsp; It <U>is</U> ready.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They are ready.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They <U>are</U> ready.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>

<!--page 52-->
Similarly, for the emphatic form of the Simple Past of the verb <B>to be</B>,
no auxiliary is used. Instead, the verb itself is stressed. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Emphatic Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I was ready.</TD><TD>&nbsp; I <U>was</U> ready.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It was ready.</TD><TD>&nbsp; It <U>was</U> ready.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They were ready.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They <U>were</U> ready.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Examples of emphatic statements in all of the present and past tenses
are given in the following table:<BR>

It should be noted that questions may be emphasized in the same way as
statements.<BR>
e.g. <U>Did</U> it work?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Are</U> they ready?<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes it is desired to emphasize a negative statement containing the
word <B>not</B>. In spoken English, often both the auxiliary and the word
<B>not</B> are stressed, but in written English, usually only the word <B>not</B>
is underlined or written in italics. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Negative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Emphatic Negative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; He does not know the answer.</TD><TD>&nbsp; He does <U>not</U> know the answer.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
When a contracted form of the word <B>not</B> is used, it is generally the
auxiliary which is stressed in an emphatic statement. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Negative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Emphatic Negative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; He doesn't know the answer.</TD><TD>&nbsp; He <U>does</U>n't know the answer.</TD></TR>
