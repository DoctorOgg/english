<CENTER><B>CHAPTER 7.&nbsp; THE FUTURE TENSES</B></CENTER></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<BR>

<!--page 58-->
Just as there are four present tenses and four past tenses in English,
there are also four future tenses: the Simple Future, the Future
Continuous, the Future Perfect, and the Future Perfect Continuous.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="1"></A>
<CENTER><B>1. The simple future</B></CENTER><BR>

<A NAME="1a"></A>
<B>a. Use</B><BR>
The Simple Future tense is used to express non-continuous actions which
will take place in the future. In the following examples, the verbs in
the Simple Future tense are underlined.<BR>
e.g. They <U>will finish</U> the work tomorrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He <U>will arrive</U> next Saturday.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1b"></A>
<B>b. Formation</B><BR>
The Simple Future of any verb is formed from the auxiliary <B>will</B> or
<B>shall</B>, followed by the bare infinitive of the verb.<BR>
<BR>
In informal English, particularly in American English, the Simple Future
is usually conjugated entirely with the auxiliary <B>will</B>. The auxiliary
<B>will</B> is a <B>modal</B> auxiliary. Modal auxiliaries do not modify, but have
the same form, regardless of the subject.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="1bco"></A>
The auxiliary <B>will</B> is often contracted to <B>'ll</B>. Thus, in informal
English, the Simple Future of the verb <B>to work</B> is usually conjugated
as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contractions</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I will work</TD><TD>&nbsp; I'll work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; you will work</TD><TD>&nbsp; you'll work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; he will work</TD><TD>&nbsp; he'll work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; she will work</TD><TD>&nbsp; she'll work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; it will work</TD><TD>&nbsp; it'll work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; we will work</TD><TD>&nbsp; we'll work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; they will work</TD><TD>&nbsp; they'll work</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Verbs used with the subjects <B>I</B> and <B>we</B> are generally referred to
as being in the <B>first person</B>; verbs used with the subject <B>you</B> are
generally referred to as being in the <B>second person</B>; and verbs used
with the subjects <B>he</B>, <B>she</B>, <B>it</B> and <B>they</B> are generally referred
to as being in the <B>third person</B>.<BR>
<BR>
For formal English, there is a rule which states that in the Simple
Future, the auxiliary <B>shall</B> should be used in the first person, and
the auxiliary <B>will</B> should be used in the second person and third
person. Like the auxiliary <B>will</B>, the auxiliary <B>shall</B> is a modal
auxiliary.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, in formal English, the Simple Future of the verb <B>to work</B> may be
conjugated as follows:<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 59-->
<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I shall work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; you will work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; he will work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; she will work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; it will work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; we shall work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; they will work</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<BR>
Even in informal English, the auxiliary <B>shall</B> is usually used in the
first person for questions in which a request for permission is implied.<BR>
e.g. <U>Shall</U> I <U>call</U> the office?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Shall</U> we <U>go</U> to the library?<BR>
<BR>
However, the use of <B>will</B> for the first person of the Simple Future is
beginning to be considered acceptable in formal English. Thus, except
for questions where a request for permission is implied, either <B>will</B> 
or <B>shall</B> may be used for the first person of the Simple Future. In
this chapter, the alternative use of the auxiliary <B>shall</B> in the first
person will be indicated by the word <B>shall</B> in brackets.
<BR>
<BR>
The rules for the use of <B>will</B> and <B>shall</B> which apply to the Simple
Future tense, also apply to the other future tenses.
<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex07.html#1">Exercise 1</A>.
<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="1c"></A>
<B>c. Questions and negative statements</B><BR>
As is the case with other English tenses, questions and negative
statements in the Simple Future are formed using the auxiliary.<BR>
<BR>
Questions are formed by placing the auxiliary before the subject. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It will work.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Will it work?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They will work.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Will they work?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Negative statements are formed by placing the word <B>not</B> after the auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Negative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It will work.</TD><TD>&nbsp; It will not work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They will work.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They will not work.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
<A NAME="1cwo"></A>
In spoken English, the following contraction is often used:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contraction</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contraction</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; will not</TD><TD>&nbsp; won't</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
The contracted form of <B>will not</B> is unusual, since it is not only the
<B>o</B> of <B>not</B> which is omitted. In addition, the <B>ll</B> of <B>will</B> is 
omitted, and the <B>i</B> of <B>will</B> is changed to <B>o</B>. The contracted form,
<B>won't</B>, is pronounced to rhyme with <B>don't</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 60-->
In addition, <B>shall not</B> is sometimes contracted to <B>shan't</B>. However,
the word <B>shan't</B> is rarely used in modern American English.<BR>
<BR>
Negative questions are formed by placing the auxiliary before the subject,
and the word <B>not</B> after the subject. However, when contractions are
used, the contracted form of <B>not</B> immediately follows the auxiliary.
The following are examples of negative questions with and without 
contractions:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contractions</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Will it not work?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Won't it work?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Will they not work?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Won't they work?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Tag questions are formed using the auxiliary. In the following examples,
the negative tag questions are underlined. Contractions are usually used
in negative tag questions.<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement with Tag Question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It will work.</TD><TD>&nbsp; It will work, <U>won't it</U>?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They will work.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They will work, <U>won't they</U>?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="2"></A>
<CENTER><B>2. The conjugation expressing determination and compulsion</B></CENTER><BR>
In formal English, there is a rule which states that, in order to
express determination and compulsion, the auxiliary <B>will</B> is to be
used in the first person, and the auxiliary <B>shall</B> is to be used in the
second person and third person. This is the reverse of the use of <B>will</B> 
and <B>shall</B> found in the Simple Future. The use of <B>will</B> in the first
person is supposed to express determination, and the use of <B>shall</B> in
the second person and third person is supposed to express compulsion.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, for the verb <B>to work</B>, the Simple conjugation which
expresses determination and compulsion is as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>I will work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>you shall work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>he shall work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>she shall work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>it shall work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>we will work</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>they shall work</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<BR>
In this conjugation, the expressions <B>I will work,</B> and <B>we will work,</B> 
have the meaning <B>I am determined to work,</B> and <B>we are determined to
work.</B> In contrast, the expressions <B>you shall work,</B> and <B>they shall
work,</B> for instance, have the meaning <B>you will be compelled to work,</B> 
and <B>they will be compelled to work.</B><BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex07.html#4">Exercise 4</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 61-->
The rule for expressing determination and compulsion which applies to
the Simple conjugation, also applies to the Continuous, Perfect, and
Perfect Continuous conjugations.<BR>
<BR>
However, particularly in American English, the use of the conjugations
expressing determination and compulsion is beginning to be considered
old-fashioned.<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="3"></A>
<CENTER><B>3. The present continuous of To Go followed by an infinitive</B></CENTER><BR>

The Present Continuous tense of <B>to go</B>, followed by an infinitive, is
often used to refer to an event which is about to happen, or to refer to
an action which someone intends to carry out in the future.<BR>
<BR>
The Present Continuous tense of the verb <B>to go</B> is conjugated as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>I am going</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>you are going</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>he is going</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>she is going</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>it is going</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>we are going</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>they are going</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<BR>
The examples below illustrate the use of the Present Continuous tense of
<B>to go</B>, followed by an infinitive, to refer to a future event. In each
of these examples, the Present Continuous of <B>to go</B> is printed in bold
type, and the infinitive which follows it is underlined.<BR>
e.g. It <B>is going</B> <U>to rain</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I <B>am going</B> <U>to write</U> a letter tonight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They <B>are going</B> <U>to study</U> in France next year.<BR>
In the first example, the use of the Present Continuous of <B>to go</B> 
followed by the infinitive <B>to rain</B> indicates that it is about to rain.
In the second and third examples, the use of the Present Continuous of
<B>to go</B> followed by the infinitives <B>to write</B> and <B>to study</B> indicates
that the actions of writing and studying are intended to be carried out
in the future.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex07.html#5">Exercise 5</A>.<BR>
<BR>
It should also be noted that the Past Continuous tense of <B>to go</B> can be
used to express actions which were about to happen in the past.<BR>
e.g. I <B>was going</B> <U>to write</U> a letter last night.<BR>
In this example, the use of the Past Continuous of <B>to go</B> followed
by the infinitive <B>to write</B> indicates that the action of writing
was intended to be carried out in the past.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>

<A NAME="4"></A>
<CENTER><B>4. The future continuous</B></CENTER><BR>

<A NAME="4a"></A>
<B>a. Use</B><BR>
The Future Continuous tense is used to express continuous, ongoing
actions which will take place in the future. In the following examples,
the verbs in the Future Continuous tense are underlined.<BR>
e.g. He <U>will be waiting</U> for us.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They <U>will be arriving</U> tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 62-->
<A NAME="4b"></A>
<B>b. Formation</B><BR>
The Future Continuous of any verb is formed from the Simple Future of
the auxiliary <B>to be</B>, followed by the present participle of the verb.
For instance, the Future Continuous of the verb <B>to work</B> is conjugated
as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>I will (shall) be working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>you will be working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>he will be working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>she will be working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>it will be working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>we will (shall) be working</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>they will be working</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex07.html#6">Exercise 6</A>.<BR>
<BR>
It can be seen that the Future Continuous tense has two auxiliaries. The
first auxiliary is <B>will</B> or <B>shall</B>, and the second auxiliary is <B>be</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="4c"></A>
<B>c. Questions and negative statements</B><BR>
As is the case with other English tenses, questions and negative
statements in the Future Continuous are formed using the first
auxiliary.<BR>
<BR>
Questions are formed by placing the first auxiliary before the subject. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It will be working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Will it be working?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They will be working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Will they be working?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Negative statements are formed by placing the word <B>not</B> after the
first auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Negative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It will be working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; It will not be working.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They will be working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They will not be working.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Negative questions are formed by placing the first auxiliary before the
subject, and the word <B>not</B> after the subject. However, when contractions
are used, the contracted form of <B>not</B> immediately follows the first
auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contractions</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Will it not be working?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Won't it be working?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; Will they not be working?</TD><TD>&nbsp; Won't they be working?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Tag questions are formed using the first auxiliary. In the following
examples, the negative tag questions are underlined. Contractions are
usually used in negative tag questions.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 63-->
<TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement with Tag Question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It will be working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; It will be working, <U>won't it</U>?</TD></TR>

The Future Perfect tense is used to refer to a non-continuous action
which will be completed by a certain time in the future. In the
following examples, the verbs in the Future Perfect tense are
underlined.<BR>
e.g. She <U>will have finished</U> the work by Wednesday.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I <U>will have cleaned</U> the room before the guests arrive.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They <U>will have eaten</U> breakfast by the time he gets up.<BR>
<BR>
In these examples, the use of the Future Perfect indicates that the
actions of finishing the work, cleaning the room, and eating breakfast
will have been completed before the coming of Wednesday, the arrival
of the guests, and his getting up take place.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="5b"></A>
<B>b. Formation</B><BR>
The Future Perfect of any verb is formed from the Simple Future of the
auxiliary <B>to have</B>, followed by the past participle of the verb. For
instance, the Future Perfect of the verb <B>to work</B> is conjugated as
follows:<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; I will (shall) have worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; you will have worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; he will have worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; she will have worked</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; it will have worked</TD></TR>

<BR>

<A NAME="5c"></A>
<B>c. Questions and negative statements</B><BR>
As is the case with other English tenses, questions and negative
statements in the Future Perfect are formed using the first
auxiliary.<BR>
<BR>
Questions are formed by placing</B> the first auxiliary before the subject. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Question</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It will have worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Will it have worked?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They will have worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Will they have worked?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Negative statements are formed by placing the word <B>not</B> after the
first auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 64-->
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Negative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; It will have worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; It will not have worked.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp; They will have worked.</TD><TD>&nbsp; They will not have worked.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Negative questions are formed by placing the first auxiliary before the
subject, and the word <B>not</B> after the subject. However, when contractions
are used, the contracted form of <B>not</B> immediately follows the first 
auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Without Contractions</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>With Contractions</B></U></TD></TR>

The Future Perfect Continuous tense is used to express a continuous,
ongoing action which will be completed by a certain time in the future.
In the following examples, the verbs in the Future Perfect Continuous
tense are underlined.<BR>
e.g. By next January, she <U>will have been living</U> here for a year.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You <U>will have been traveling</U> a great deal by the time you return home.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He <U>will have been working</U> for ten months by the time he takes his
vacation.<BR>
<BR>
In these examples, the use of the Future Perfect Continuous indicates
that the continuous, ongoing actions of living, traveling, and working,
will have been completed before the events of the coming of January,
your returning home, and his taking a vacation, take place.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="6b"></A>
<B>b. Formation</B><BR>
The Future Perfect Continuous of any verb is formed from the Future

<B>c. Questions and negative statements</B></CENTER><BR>
As is the case with other English tenses, questions and negative
statements in the Future Perfect Continuous are formed using the
first auxiliary.<BR>
<BR>
Questions are formed by placing the first auxiliary before the subject. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Question</B></U></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp; They will have been working.</TD><TD>&nbsp; Will they have been working?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Negative statements are formed by placing the word <B>not</B> after the
first auxiliary. For example:<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<TR><TD><U><B>Affirmative Statement</B></U></TD><TD><U><B>Negative Statement</B></U></TD></TR>

<BR>
Negative questions are formed by placing the first auxiliary before the
subject, and the word <B>not</B> after the subject. However, when contractions

<CENTER><B>8. Clauses</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
If a sentence has only one subject and one verb, it is said to consist
of a single clause, called the <B>main</B> or <B>principal</B> clause. A <B>main 
clause</B> is a clause which can stand alone to form a complete sentence.
Each of the following sentences has only one clause. In the following
examples, the verbs are underlined.<BR>
e.g. It <U>is</U> cold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The flowers <U>are blooming</U>.<BR>
<BR>
If a sentence contains more than one verb, and each verb has its own
subject, the sentence is said to consist of more than one clause. The
following sentences each have two clauses. The verbs are underlined.<BR>
e.g. He <U>said</U> that he <U>was</U> ready.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The door <U>opened</U>, and my uncle <U>entered</U> the room.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, <B>he said</B> is the first clause, and <B>that he was
ready</B> is the second clause. In the second example, <B>the door opened</B> 
is the first clause, and <B>my uncle entered the room</B> is the second
clause.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="8a"></A>
<B>a. Coordinate clauses</B><BR>
When two clauses are joined by a word such as <B>and</B>, <B>or</B> or <B>but</B>, the
two clauses are called <B>coordinate</B> clauses, and the word which joins them
is called a <B>coordinate conjunction</B>. In the following examples, the verbs are underlined.<BR>
e.g. It <U>is</U> cold, but the flowers <U>are blooming</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The flowers <U>are blooming</U> and the birds <U>are singing</U>.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the coordinate conjunction <B>but</B> joins the clause
<B>it is cold</B> to the clause <B>the flowers are blooming</B>. In the second
example, the coordinate conjunction <B>and</B> joins the clause <B>the flowers
are blooming</B> to the clause <B>the birds are singing</B>. The clauses in
these examples are coordinate clauses.<BR>
<BR>

<!--page 67-->
<A NAME="8b"></A>
<B>b. Subordinate clauses</B><BR>
Coordinate clauses are main clauses. A main clause is grammatically
independent, in that it may stand alone to form a complete sentence. In
contrast, a clause which describes some part of the main clause, or which
is in some other way grammatically dependent on the main clause, is
called a <B>subordinate</B> clause. A subordinate clause cannot stand alone
to form a complete sentence.<BR>
<BR>
In the following examples, the subordinate clauses are underlined.<BR>
e.g. The book <U>which I lent you</U> is a library book.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He told me <U>what he had seen.</U><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>If you are ready</U>, we will go.<BR>
<BR>
In the preceding examples, the main clauses are <B>the book is a library
book</B>, <B>he told me</B> and <B>we will go</B>; and the subordinate clauses are
<B>which I lent you</B>, <B>what he had seen</B> and <B>if you are ready</B>. A
subordinate clause usually begins with a connecting word or phrase which
joins it to the main clause. In the preceding examples, these connecting
words are <B>which</B>, <B>what</B> and <B>if</B>.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="8c"></A>
<B>c. The past perfect and the simple past</B><BR>
It has already been seen that the tense of a verb in one clause is
related to the tenses of verbs in other clauses in the same sentence.
For instance, if one action happened before another in the past, the
action that happened first would usually be expressed by a verb in the
Past Perfect tense, and the action that happened subsequently would
usually be expressed by a verb in the Simple Past tense.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, each of the following sentences has one verb in the Past
Perfect tense, and one verb in the Simple Past tense. In the following
examples, the verbs are underlined.<BR>
e.g. She <U>was</U> late, because she <U>had lost</U> her way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It <U>had started</U> to snow before we <U>reached</U> the inn.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the verb <B>had lost</B> is in the Past Perfect, and
the verb <B>was</B> is in the Simple Past. This indicates that the action of
losing the way occurred before the action of being late. In the second
example, the verb <B>had started</B> is in the Past Perfect, and the verb
<B>reached</B> is in the Simple Past. This indicates that the action of
starting to snow occurred before the action of reaching the inn.<BR>
<BR>

<B>d. The use of the present in subordinate clauses to express future actions</B><BR>
It should be noted that if the verb in the main clause of a sentence is
in a future tense, the verb of any subordinate clause which refers to
the future is usually in a present tense. This is illustrated in the
following examples. The verbs are underlined.<BR>
e.g. We <U>will welcome</U> him when he <U>arrives</U>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I <U>will have finished</U> the work before it <U>is</U> time to leave.<BR>
<BR>
In these examples, the main clauses are <B>we will welcome him</B> and
<B>I will have finished the work</B>; and the subordinate clauses are
<B>when he arrives</B> and <B>before it is time to leave</B>. In the main

<!--page 68-->
clauses, the <B>will welcome</B> is in the Simple Future tense, and the <B>will have finished</B> is in the Future Perfect tense. However, in the subordinate clauses, the verbs
<B>arrives</B> and <B>is</B> are both in the Simple Present, even though they
refer to future events.<BR>
<BR>
In most cases, the rule is that if the verb in the main clause of a
sentence is in a future tense, the verb of any subordinate clause which
refers to the future must be in a present tense. There is usually no
ambiguity in such sentences, because the fact that the verb in the main
clause is in a future tense is generally enough to indicate that all of
the actions expressed in the sentence are to take place in the future.<BR>
<BR>
See <A HREF="gramex07.html#15">Exercise 15</A>.<BR>
<BR>
However, there are a few cases in which the verb in a subordinate
clause must be put into a future tense in order to avoid ambiguity.
For instance, in subordinate clauses beginning with <B>although</B> or
<B>because</B>, it is sometimes necessary to use future tenses, to make it
clear that the actions expressed relate to the future, rather than the
present.<BR>
<BR>
e.g. We will not <U>need</U> to send for her, because she <U>will</U> already <U>be</U> here.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although he <U>will be</U> in the neighborhood, we <U>will have</U> to search for
him.<BR>
<BR>
In these examples, the use of the Simple Future tense in the subordinate
clauses <B>because she will already be here</B> and <B>although he will be in
the neighborhood</B> is necessary to make it clear that the events of her
being here, and his being in the neighborhood, relate to the future
rather than the present.
