English 0.3.0 is out! This new version provides two awesome
improvements.

English has gained a new Style module which extends the
String class. This mixin provides an assortment of String
alteration methods such as titlecase, jumble, pathize, etc;
all the ones you would expect and then some.

English's Inflect performance has been greatly improved.
Inflect has used sorting and a comparision loop to find matches
for singular and plural conversions. Now it uses a single Regexp
which handles all the matching grunt work on it's own and
provides a 10x performance gain! Special thanks goes to
Wycats for this superb work on this.
